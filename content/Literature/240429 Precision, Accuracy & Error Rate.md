## Precision
It is proportion of the **Positive** classifications that were actually correct. 

$$
\text{Precision}=\dfrac{TP}{TP+FP}
$$

## Accuracy
It is the ration of **True** predictions of a model to all the Predictions. 

$$
\text{Accuracy}=\dfrac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}
$$

## Error Rate 

$$
\text{ER} = 1-\text{ACC}
$$


> Note: Accuracy and Error Rate formulas stated above also work for Multi-category classifications.
