## Part I: Can you judge a book by it's cover?
### The fault in our faculties
- [[230717 Double Blind Study|Double Blind Study]]
- [[230717 Barnum Effect|Barnum Effect]]
- Profiling is as good as Cold reading
	Believablity = High base rate quantity + unverifiable/random guesses  
	We tend to confirm existing biases and even go so far as building a story to make it true. A convincing way to make something believable. 
 
	This is why police profiling just ends up being similar to cold reading. 

Once the initial bias has been set, people tend to find creative ways to justify and make the story fit in like a puzzle. 

> The key part to get a good sense of a person is then not to build skill on some kind body language reading or lie detection, it is to step back and overcome our own cognitive biases. 

**Why first impressions aren't reliable**
- Judging a book by it's cover is a passive evaluation. 
- Non-verbal cues are idiosyncratic and utterly useless without a baseline (which again is idiosyncratic across people). 
- The ability to overcome cognitive biases, goes hand in had with improving empathetic abilities.  

**Accurately gauging people has to do with making people more readable rather than developing some skill for it. Some pointers:**
- Just generally being curious and interested. 
- How people behave in different contexts (sport, different environment, people). 
- How they treat others. 

**However if you did wanna focus on something**
- Focus on the speech (how it changes with the circumstance) rather than the body language.  
- Not seeing someone decreases empathetic ability by 4%, not listening to someone decreases the ability by 54%. 

### How to resist confirmation bias
1. Feel accountable 
	> If your opinion on someone could result in them getting the death penalty, you'd slow down and be more thorough. 
	
2. Distance before decision
3. Consider the opposite. 
	> If I have an idea and have observation to support it, rather than get that out there, I go around and look at it in different ways and try and destroy it. And only if it survives do I begin to talk about it.

### How to Weed Out bad actors 
**The Friendly Journalist Method**
- As opposed to a bad cop. 
- Don't accuse, be curious. 
- Lying take a lot of work. Let them yap around and they might contradict themselves. Let them paint themselves into a corner. 
- Liers improve their lies with feedback. DON'T give them feed back. Be the friendly journalist.

> Whether you’re trying to decipher their personality or detect lies, the biggest gains in accuracy are achieved by getting them to increase the signals they’re sending. You can’t make yourself much better at detecting lies, but you can leverage solid methods like cognitive load and strategic use of evidence to make people so bad at telling them that it’ll be much easier to notice.

## Is "A Friend in Need a Friend Indeed?"
**Some facts**
- 70% of Marital satisfaction is due to the couple's friendship. (Gallup)
- If you see your Manager as a friend -> you are **2.5 times** more likely to enjoy your job. 
- If you have 3 pals at work -> you're 96% more likely to feel more happy with **LIFE**.
- To have the same odds, you would have to earn $ 97K more per year. 
- In total friendship variables account for 58 percent of your happiness. 
> Why do true friendships make us happier than spouses or children? Because they're always a deliberate choice, never an obligation. 
> The fragility of friendship proves its purity.
