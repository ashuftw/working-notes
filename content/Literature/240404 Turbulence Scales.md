## Integral ($L$)
These Vortices occur at the scale of the Integral Motion of the fluid and are affected by the Integral Flow Quantities like geometry size $L$ and flow velocity $U_0$.
## Inertial ($l$)
They comprise of the Vortices that transfer energy from the Integral scale to smaller scales. They are responsible for the Energy Cascade Phenomena. 
## Dissipative Scale ($\eta$)
Also known as the *Kolmogorov* scale, where the energy is finally dissipated into heat through molecular viscosity without further creation of smaller eddies.
