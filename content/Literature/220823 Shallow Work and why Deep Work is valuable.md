2012 McKinsey Report stated that up to 60% of an employee work hours is spent interacting with the internet, with 30% being just Email.  

**Shallow work**
Work that *is* done or *can* be done in a distracted state. It is work that can be easily replicated and hence does not add much value to the world and hence by nature isn't valuable. 

>Spend enough time doing shallow work and you lose the ability to do Deep work. 

**Deep Work Hypothesis**
> Ability to perform Deep Work is becoming rare and hence valuable in our economy. Few that cultivate this skill, will thrive.
