It is a type of [[230612 Fixed point or Banach's iteration|Banach's iteration]] 
### Mathematically
We assume that there is a fixed point $k$ in the domain of $x$ such that
$$g(x_k) = x_k$$
The general iteration formula 
$$ \begin{aligned}
& g(x_{k+1})=x_{k+1}=x_k-\lambda\cdot\frac{f(x_k)}{D} \\
\end{aligned}$$
$\text { e.g. } \lambda=1, D=\nabla f\left(x_k\right)$
 $$g(x_{k+1})=x_{k}-\frac{f(x_{k})}{f'(x_{k})}$$
