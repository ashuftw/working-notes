Given are two random variables $X_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(2,0.5)$ and $X_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(3,1.5)$. They can be represented as a vector $\binom{X_1}{X_2}$. There holds $\mathbb{E}\left[X_1 X_2\right]=6$.
Using the KL expansion, find $\binom{X_1}{X_2}=f\binom{\xi_1}{\xi_2}$ with $\xi_1, \xi_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$.
