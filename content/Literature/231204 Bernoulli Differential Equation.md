## Definition
An ODE is called a Bernoulli Differential equation if it can be represented in the form

$$
y'+a(t) y= p(t)\ y^\mathbf n
$$


$$
\text{ODE}=
\begin{cases}
\text{linear,} & \text{if} \ n = 0\\
\text{linear, } y \text{ can be moved to LHS} & \text{if}\ n=1 \\
\text{non-linear, }n \in\Bbb R, y\ne 0 & \text{if} \ n > 1
\end{cases}
$$

> Note: Calculate $u'$ with RHS the way it is. Bringing it to LHS makes it less clean.
