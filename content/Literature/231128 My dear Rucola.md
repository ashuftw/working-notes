At the sea for years
Holding up my fears
Been away so long 

In the quiet, in the storms 
But I'm back 
Back for good 

To you my Rucola 
My dear rucola 
My dear rucola 

Wait till the morrow 
I'm hurrying up home 
I've finished my work here
Just enough don't fear To last at least year My rucola My Rucola My dear rucola
