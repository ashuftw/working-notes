### Intuition
It is the rate at which a Numerical Method converges to the exact solution as step size approaches zero. 

- **$\text I$ Order Accurate:** Truncation Error decreases proportional to the decrease in the step size. 
- **$\text {II}$ Order Accurate:** Truncation Error decreases Quadratically  i.e. if the step size decreases by half it's original size, the error is a quarter of the previous error.
