A Bar (or measure) is the unit scale of time in a piece of music. 

The length of music can be expressed in bars but it doesn't inherently hold any metric of time unless the BPM is mentioned. 

$$
\text{Length of Song}= \text{No. of Bars}\times\dfrac{\text{Time Signature}}{BPM}\ [\text{Minutes}]
$$
