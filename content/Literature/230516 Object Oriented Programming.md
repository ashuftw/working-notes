## **Key Concepts**
1. **Data Encapsulation:** Bundles data and methods within an object, hiding internal details and providing controlled access to the data.
2. **Inheritance:** Enables a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class, promoting code reusability and hierarchical organization.
3. **Polymorphism:** It allows objects to perform different functions based on the context (Class/Subclass) they are called in. In Python, this is mainly done usingÂ **Method Overriding**.
4. **Data Abstraction:** Hides implementation details, exposing only essential features of an object, improving code manageability and maintainability.

5. [[230802 Composition|Composition]]: It allows a class to leverage the behaviors and functionalities of its component classes without necessarily inheriting from them. This is done by including the other class in the body of the object.
