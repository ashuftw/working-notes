## Steps involved in selecting the Hyper Parameters
1. **Split Data** 
	- The available data is split into subsets namely the *Training Set*, *Validation Set* and the *Test Set*. 
2. **Training**
	- Here the model parameters are learned. 
3. **Validation**
	- The model is then parameterized with different *Hyper-parameters $\lambda$*. This is also known as tuning the model. 
1. **Test Set**
	- Finally the model is tested to evaluate it's performance. Here the Generalization error can be calculated (How well the model deals with unseen data.)

> Note: The Hyper Parameters may be the Learning Rate $(\eta)$, Regularisation parameter $(\lambda)$ etc.
