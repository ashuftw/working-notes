## Definition
It is a statistical measure that quantifies how linear the relationship between two variables is. 

## Coefficient of Correlation

$$
\rho[X, Y]=\frac{\operatorname{cov}[X, Y]}{\sqrt{\mathbb{V}[X] \mathbb{V}[Y]}}
$$

Note: $\rho[X, Y] \in[-1,1]$
- $\rho = -1$: Negative Linear relationship
- $\rho = 0$: non linear relationship 
- $\rho =+1$: Positive linear relationship

At $-1$ and $+1$, the Correlation is perfectly linear.
