  
## Definition
A differential Equation where the dependent variable is linear in called  a Linear Differential Equation. 

In general 
$$
y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(t)
$$

Where, $y\rightarrow$ is linear in every derivative and $a_i(t)$ is arbitrary function dependent on the particular equation under study that don't have to be linear. 
## Example
1. **Linear Differential Equation** 
 
$$
y'' +y =0
$$

2.  **Nonlinear Differential Equation:**
	
$$
y''+ y^2 =0
$$
