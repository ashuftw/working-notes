# Introduction to Multiphase Flows
### Appendix 1
#### A1.1 Conservation Equations for "Closed Systems"
- In Thermodynamics, System = Mass  
- Closed system $\rightarrow$ No mass exchange 
> Conservation laws can be written for a closed system and constitute the basis for the solution of all thermodynamics, mechanics, and what engineers call “thermal-hydraulics” problems (combination of heat transfer and fluid mechanics or hydraulics).
- The three fundamental conservation laws:
  1. Conservation of Mass
    - Eg: Deformation of a baloon (change in volume, mass is same)

  2. Conservation of Momentum (Newton's law of motion)
    - Sum of all forces applied on a body equals the rate of change of momentum in that body

  3. Conservation of Energy (First Law of Thermodynamics)
    -  Heat added to the system minus work done by the system equals change in the internal energy $E^\circ$

    - $dE^\circ$ indicates that $E^\circ$ is a thermodynamic Property 
## Chapter 1: Nature of Multiphase Flows and Basic Concepts
**Multiphase Flow**: It is the flow of materials with two or more phases. Eg. oil-water mixture, slurry etc. 

### Phenomena Unique to Multiphase flow
**Critical Heat Flux (CHF)**
In a *Pool Boiling* case where $T_w$ & $T_{sat}$ are Wall and saturation temperatures. 
When the difference between water and the Wall reaches *CHF*, the heat disparity rapidly increases as there is very little cooling of the wall as the water has changed to vapor and the heat transfer & density of Steam is less compared to water. Because there is no cooling, the Wall may fail. 
First reported by Nukiyama's *Boiling curve*.[^1]
