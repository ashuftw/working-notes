In [[240813 Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS)|RANS modeling]] the problem of figuring out a way to calculate $\tau^{turb}_{ij}$ in the Momentum Equations is called the [[240813 The Closure Problem of RANS|closure problem]]
$$\boxed{
\frac{\partial \bar{u}_i}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial \bar{u}_i \bar{u}_j}{\partial x_j}=-\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left[v \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}+\tau_{i j}^{t u r b}\right]}
$$
