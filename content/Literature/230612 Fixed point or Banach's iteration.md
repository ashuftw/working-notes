It is a Numerical Method used to find the solution to an equation (when the analytical solution is difficult or impossible to find). 

It assumes that a function $f$ has a fixed point i.e. $f(x)=x$ 

### Solution Step
1. Write the given function in terms of $x$, 
	given $x^2+x=1$
	Search $g$	
$$
x=g(x)=\frac{1}{x+1}
$$

1. Apply the function repeatedly on a guess value till convergence 
$$
x_{n+1}=g(x_n)
$$

	where $x_n$ starts as some guess value.
