## Normal Distribution or Gaussian Distribution
It is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean. i.e, the probability of the mean is the highest and then reduces as the outcome strays away from the mean. 

$$
X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

## Lognormal Distribution
It is a probability distribution where the Logarithm of the Random variable is normally distributed. 
i.e, 
$$
ln(X)\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)
$$
