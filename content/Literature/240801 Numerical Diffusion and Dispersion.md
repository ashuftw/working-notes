Depending on how the [[230228 Navier-Stokes Equations|Navier-Stokes Equations]] are discretized, the Error term tends to behave in a certain way. 
 -  **Backward or Upwind Scheme** produces an Error term whose leading term has diffusive behaviour.
 - **Central Scheme** produces an Error term whose leading term have dispersive behaviour (oscillation).

> Note: All discretization schemes will have a Truncation error because by definition one *approximates* a continuous phenomenon to a discrete equivalent.
