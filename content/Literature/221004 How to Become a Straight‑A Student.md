## Efficiency is your sword. Cut that Grind
- You need to find strategies that work for _you_. 
- Get work done quickly and minimize wasted effort.

$$
\text{Work accomplished = Time spent}\times \text{Intensity of focus}
$$

- Spread out sessions of intense work so that you are recharged.  
 > A little organization goes a hell of a long way.
 
## Step 1: Five minute Day-Plan
- Collect important tasks, events, plans etc. on a piece of paper. Mince words 'cause you're gonna look at it soon.
- Next morning, mark future events on the Calendar and transfer tasks into [Time blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eff9h1WYxSo). 
- As you go through the day, crossing your Time blocks, collect commitments on the back page. 
- Repeat
- Tip: Things come-up, tasks take longer. Be pessimistic about time while planning. 

## Step 2: War on Procrastination
1. **Do some meta work**: If you don't feel like doing something, it just means that your plan isn't good enough. 
2. **Ego @ EoD**: At the end of the day, if you complete all tasks, sign off with an **all completed**. If you don't, write a short explanation as to why.
3. **Feed the machine**:
	- Drink water constantly (actually works. I keep a bottle with me at all time now).
	- Monitor Caffeine intake.
	- Eat right and don't skip meals.
4. **Make an event out of it**:
	- Build up the task with people around you and gripe about it.
	- Go to a different location, a coffee shop or so. Just to *conquer* this task. 
5. **Have it on a routine**
6. **Reward yourself with an off day**: You will have difficult days, if you do try to schedule work so that you don't have two days in a row. If you have to work during the weekend, schedule work on Saturday and take Sunday off. 

**Reality Check**
> To date, I have yet to have successfully followed any time management system without interruption for longer than two months. You hit a rough patch and you will snap back. They are normal. 
## Step 3: When, Where and How Long
- **When**: During the day. Try to fit in pockets of time before classes, after classes etc. Mind shuts down after 7-8 PM. 
- **Where**: In isolation. Rotating spots is a good tip if you're in a slump. 
- **How long**: Not more than 1 hour without at least a 5 minute break. Retention drops to 30% after 2 hours of continuous work[^1]. Recommended, 40-50 minute increments.
# Part 2
## Step 1: Take Smart notes 
- Studying on your own takes **twice** as long. 
- **My tip**: If you don't understand the material, prepare for it before hand. 
- Maintain a folder for each class where you put in respective notes, quizzes, handouts etc.
1. Non Technical Classes
	- Focus on the **Big ideas**. 
	- **Question-Evidence-Conclusion**: Apply this heuristic to deconstruct any idea. 
	- Use shorthand -  Make them readable/concrete in the next study session. 
	- Clean up notes in the closing of the lecture or during pauses.
2. Technical Classes
	- Focus on **Details**.
	- Record example and sample problems. Annotate steps during pauses. 
	- For practice problems (which tend to move quickly) record the Question, answer & solution hint. 
	- Form questions when something isn't clear. Try to get clarification from Prof. More unanswered questions mean more legwork later.
	- Bring recommended reading to class but don't read them before class as they tend to get covered in lecture. (For hard subjects read them before hand)
## Step 2: How to approach assignments: Demote them
- Spread out Problem sets/ recommended reading throughout the week. 
- Even on busy days, carve out a few minutes reserved for this. 
- **Solve problems on the go**:
	- Familiarize the example problems from notes. 
	- Attempt the most straight forward method.
	- If unsuccessful, move on to do something else. 
	- Think about it the problem on the move: in lines, on the way to campus, between classes etc. 
	- Schedule time for the problem sets when you have some idea to approach the problem. 
	- Write each solution like the final submission. Rewriting is a waste of time. 
## Step 3: Marshal your resources 
- **Define the challenge**
	- Learn about the type of exam. 
	- Logistics of the test. 
	- Past papers, important topics etc. 
- **Build a study guide (non-Technical Courses**)
	- Print out your notes, assignments etc. 
	- Organize by topic. 
	- Put a paper clip on each pile consisting of a top. 
- **Build a Mega Problem Set (Technical Courses)**
	- Compile questions and take a note on which lecture it belongs to. 
	- Add Technical Explanation
	- Also add questions from practice exams. 
- **Prepare memorization aids**
	- Make Flash cards
	- If an ideas is too big, split them into multiple questions
- **Don't Organize the same day you plan to review**
## Step 4: Conquer the material
- **Trust the Quiz and Recall Method**
	- **Trap**: It's easy to regurgitate something and get the impression that you've understood it. 
	- If you can't teach it, you don't know it. 
	- If you can't reproduce a solution, you don't know how to solve the problem. 
	- Recalling should be an external activity: Write down the answer, or recite the explanation out loud like a lecture. 
	- Walking is good for Quiz and Recall sessions. 
	- Spread out the recall sessions, there's only so much you can memorize in one day.
	- Workflow:
		- Can't recall -> Idea too big 
		- Can't solve a practice paper -> Quizzes are weak
		- Still stuck -> contact a TA or classmate
## Step 5: Academic Disaster Insurance
On how to avoid a poor exam. 
- **Each Question Mark is a ticking bomb**
- Eliminate "**Question marks**" in the near future of when you collect them. 
- Ask Profs after the lecture, make use of office hours, ask classmates, take advantage of exam prep classes.
## Step 6: Provide A+ answers
- **Review**: Take a look at the questions, this will put your mind to ease and also activate the brain and prep it for the upcoming questions. 
- **Start with the easy ones**: Will set you up for success. Skip the hard ones for later. 
- **Budget your time**: Subtract 10 mins from the test and assign ETA for each question. If you don't complete one on time, skip
- **Create an Outline**: For dense answers, create a few points in short hand. They can even be questions. 
- **Review answers**: If you finish before time, augment your answers. It's okay if you break format, exams are for answers.
