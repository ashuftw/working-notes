A viscoelastic fluid in a simple shear flow produces unequal normal stresses that have non-zero values. 
$$
P_{xx}\ne P_{yy} \ne P_{zz}
$$

In Practice, it is easier to measure the differences between the stresses. 

$$
\end{align}&\text{Primary normal stress difference, } N_1=P_{xx}-P_{yy}\\ &\text{Secondary normal stress difference, }N_2=P_{yy}-P_{zz}\end{align}
$$

When coupled with the Shear rate, the Stress difference is useful to analyse rheological properties. 

$$
\end{align}&\text{Primary normal stress coefficient, } \psi_1=\dfrac{N_1}{(\dot \gamma_{yx})^2}\\ &\text{Secondary normal stress coefficient, }\psi_2=\dfrac{N_2}{(\dot \gamma_{yx})^2}\end{align}
$$

# Frage: How does the deviatoric stresses relate?
