## Deduction

It is a way of arriving at a type of reasoning that by using multiple theorems as a basis. 
**Example**: *No fruit is savoury, apple is a fruit. Therefore Apple is not savoury.* 

## Abduction

You apply a logic/rule/commonsense to an observation and derive a plausibility.
**Example:** *Small chunk of an apple is missing. Therefore a person must have taken a bite.*

## Induction 

You use data to derive a rule/theory that is applicable more generally.
**Example:** *A whole number between 1-100 when multiplied with 2 gives an even number. Therefore every whole number multiplied by two is also an even number.*

## Empiricism

It is a valid scientific means to generate knowledge if we accept that hypotheses case only be tested and falsified, but never proven. (More: K. Popper)
	(Co-relation is not causation)

## Inductive Bias

The inductive bias of a learning algorithm is a set of assumptions that a learner uses to generalize for situations that are beyond or not present in the training data.
