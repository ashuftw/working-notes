## Why Ultralearning Matters
> Technology exaggerates both the vices and the virtues of humanity. Our vices are made worse because now they are downloadable, portable, and socially transmissible. 

> The core of the Ultralearning strategy is **intensity** and a willingness to **prioritize effectiveness**. 

## How to become an Ultralearner?
(Montebello: Scott's Reader who took up Public Speaking as an Ultralearning Project)
> He asked for feedback every time he gave a speech, and he got plenty of it. His coach, Gendler, pushed him far outside of his comfort zone. Once, when faced with the choice between polishing an existing speech and creating a brand-new one from scratch, de Montebello asked what he should do. **Gendlerâ€™s response was to do whichever was scariest for him**.

## Principles
### 1. Meta-learning
	Meta - Greek word for "beyond". It is a high-level layer of abstraction. 
	Learning to define the objective of learning something can make it easier to plan them.  
- **Why?**
	```mermaid
		graph TD;
		a[Motivation] --> b[Instrumental] --> d[Means to an end]
		a[Motivation] --> c[Intrinsic] --> e[For the fun of it]
	```
- **What?**
	Interview those at the other side. Experts, professionals, achievers. In instrumental cases, what you ought to learn can be very different from what's readily available to learn. 
- **How?**
	- See the most common way to learn the thing. 
	- Include / Exclude stuff based on your needs.
	- If you can't decide, stick to the benchmark.
- **Organisational info on Meta learning**
	- Good rule of thumb is to spend 10% of the time expected to finish a learning project on Meta learning. 
	- However, this does not scale. 
	- Benefits of meta-learning decreases with time spent on the project and tend to be non-linear at later stages. 
	- Ability to Meta learn improves with multiple finished projects and can make future projects easier to take on. 
	- More often than not, Ultralearners end up valuing the Meta-learning capability acquired during a project more than the individual project itself.
