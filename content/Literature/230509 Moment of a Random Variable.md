## Definition
The moment of a Random variable is the [[230505 Expected Value|expected value]] of the Random variable raised to some power. 

### Raw Moment

$$
\mathbb{M}^k[X]  =\mathbb{E}\left[X^k\right]
$$

### Central Moment 
Is the moment of a Random variable that has been adjusted to be around the mean of mean of the distribution. 

$$
\tilde{\mathbb{M}}^k[X]  =\mathbb{E}\left[(X-\mathbb{E}[X])^k\right]
$$


**Note:** 
- 1st Moment -> Mean
- 2nd Moment -> Variance 
- 3rd Moment -> Skewness
