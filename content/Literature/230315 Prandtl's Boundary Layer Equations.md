Prandtl simplified the Navier-Stokes Equations for the Laminar Boundary Layer. The main simplification is that the pressure is constant along the height of the boundary layer. 

## Continuity Equation
$$\nabla\cdot \vec U=0$$
## Momentum Equation
$$\begin{aligned}
\rho\left(u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) & =-\frac{d p}{d x}+\mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}
\end{aligned}$$
Note: $y-$â€Šmomentum equations are not considered 'cause they are trivial (we assume there's no change)
### Addendum
$$\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} =0$$
