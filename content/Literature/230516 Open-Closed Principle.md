## Definition
"A module should be open for extensions, but closed for modifications."

This principle ensures extension of modules/components without changing the core source code of the application.

**Tool Used:** [[210613 Polymorphism|Polymorphism]] [[230801 Protocols|Protocols]] 

**Note**: Open-Closed Principle can be enforced without the implementation of Protocols. But the use of Protocol is considered best practice.
