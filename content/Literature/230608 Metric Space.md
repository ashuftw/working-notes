A metric space is a mathematical formalization of space. So a metric space is a set elements called points. Each point is said to have a distance between them. The notion of what distance means differentiates different metric spaces. 

Some popular metric spaces are: 
- **Euclidean Space** 
- **Complex numbers** 
- **Real numbers** 
### Mathematical Definition
A Metric space in an ordered pair $(M,d)$ where
- $M\rightarrow$ Set of elements (points).
- $d\rightarrow$ distance function (metric) is defined as 
$$
d:X\times X\rightarrow \mathbb R
$$

	Here the distance functions takes two elements from $M$ and maps it to a single real number which is supposed to represent the distance between the two points.
