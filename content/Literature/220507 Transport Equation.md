# Transport Equation
The transport equation defines how a quantity travels across a [[220511 Field|field]]. Some examples of transport equations are:
1. [[Mass Transport equation]]
2. [[220507 Momentum Transport equation]]
3. [[Species Transport equation]]
4. [[Total Energy Equation]]

Most transport equations take the form 
$$
\text{Temporal term }+\text{Convection term }=\text{Diffusion term}+\text{Source term}
$$

Additional quantities like turbulence, take the form of source term.
