Eddies which are Characteristic of Turbulent flows contain mechanical energy. The transfer of Energy from the fluctuation motion of a large scale Eddy to a smaller scale eddies which further transfer the energy to internal energy (viscous conversion of mechanical energy to heat) is known as energy Cascade.
