## Anisotropic Turbulence 
Here the diagonal components of the [[240813 Reynolds Stress Tensor and Turbulent Shear Stress|Reynolds Stresses]] have different values. This means that there is a preference for the direction of fluctuations i.e. non-Diagonal components have non-Zero values. 

## Isotropic Turbulence
Here the Reynolds Normal Stresses are equal to each other. Therefore the fluctuations do not have a preferred directions and the non-Diagonal components are zero.

## Turbulent Kinetic Energy
$$
k = \frac{1}{2}(\overline{u'^2} + \overline{v'^2} + \overline{w'^2}) = \frac{1}{2}\overline{u_i'^2}$$
