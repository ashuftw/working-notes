Momentum thickness  $\delta_x$  denotes the height of an imaginary filament with free stream velocity, that contains exactly the total amount of Momentum lost through viscous effect near the wall.   
  
The momentum thickness is a function of $x$ and increases in the  $x-$ direction.  
  
We have the Drag over a flat plate
