# non-Newtonian Fluid
- A non-Newtonian fluid is a type of fluid where the viscosity is dependent on the ratio of shear stress to the shear rate.Â Hence, it is called **apparent viscosity** $\eta_a$.
- This means that the viscosity is not constant for a given temperature and pressure, and is dependant on flow conditions like geometry, shear rate, type of flow (steady, unsteady etc).
- Thus the flow curve of a non-Newtonian fluid is non-linear and does not pass through the origin.
