## Definition
A Fundamental Solution (Also called fundamental Set or Matrix) is a set of all linearly independent solutions which can express every possible solution of an ODE. 
## Example 
The ODE:

$$
y'' + y = 0
$$


The general solution:

$$
y(t) = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)
$$


The fundamental solution set:

$$
\{\cos(t), \sin(t)\}
$$


An example solution:

$$
y(t) = 2\cos(t) + 3\sin(t)
$$
