The relationship scale and sensitivity is diminishing. Small changes in smaller scale tend to evoke a bigger sense of change than changes at larger scales. 

Example:
- A pen that costs 10 bucks is offered for 5 bucks at a store that's 5 miles away from your house. You're very likely to go to that shop to get that deal, even though that's inconvenient. 
- A new computer costs 1000 bucks and you know for a fact that it costs 995 at a another store store. You're likely to buy the 1000 Euro computer. Even though in both you save 5 euros.
