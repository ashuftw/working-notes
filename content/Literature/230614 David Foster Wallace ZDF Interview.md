Interviewer: Do you think that is something that is true? That humor can only come out of something sad?

0:14

I know that Wittgenstein believed that the most serious and profound

0:24

problems and questions and issues could be discussed only in the form of jokes. I know in U.S. literature

0:34

there is a tradition from about the 50s and 60s called "black humor",

0:40

which is a very kind of sardonic sad type of humor.

0:46

I'm grasping for something interesting to say in response. I think probably sometimes it can be

0:53

and sometimes it isn't. There are forms of humor that offer escapes from pain.

1:00

And there are forms of humor that transfigure pain.

1:06

Interviewer: Because in your books ... Does that make any sense? Interviewer: Yeah. Definitely.

1:11

Now the perspiration starts. Okay.

1:16

You know what would help me? Tell me what you think. If we do this as a conversation it will be easier for me.

1:22

Interviewer: Yeah, sure. And, you know, I wrote my Master's Thesis about Thomas Bernhard.

1:28

And Thomas Bernhard has a theory that you know, he was very, he had this lung sickness

1:34

so he couldn't breathe all his life. His life was very hard for him. And also he hated Austria, where he lived.

1:43

And he thought they were all Nazis. There was all this Catholic fascism. And he was just hating everything,

1:50

but then out of that he developed this really strange sense of humor. So his novels are very dark,

1:56

but at the same time, for me, very witty. And also this humor comes

2:02

some sort of music and all that. And I just wanted to know if you think that is true

2:09

that the kind of sense of humor that you like comes out of this bitterness and sadness.

2:22

The answer for myself is I don't know. I know that very often, humor is a response

2:29

to things that are difficult.

2:34

In the U.S. there's a strange situation where in some respects, humor and irony are

2:43

political responses and they're reductive. And in another sense, particularly in

2:49

popular entertainment, irony and a kind of dark humor can become a way of -

2:58

It's pretending to protest when it really isn't. Someone once called irony the song of a bird

3:04

that has come to love its cage. And even though it sings about not liking the cage, it really likes it in there.

3:14

So that it can be both a wake-up call and an anesthetic.

3:20

And the difference in the U.S. now is

3:25

very tricky and very complicated, it seems to me. Interviewer: And what would you think is true for your books?

3:32

For me, they have very serious questions.

3:38

And they are often very sad, but at the same time you get the sense of humor in there somehow.

3:54

I'm not often all that aware of stuff that's really funny in the book.

3:59

In the American version of "Infinite Jest", I set out to write a sad book.

4:05

And when people liked it and told me the thing they liked about it was that it was so funny,

4:10

it was just very surprising. It's the other strange thing about humor.

4:17

I teach school and I teach literature and some of what I teach is Kafka. And there's a story about Kafka,

4:22

that in some of Kafka's most horrific stories his neighbors would complain,

4:28

because he would be laughing so hard late at night, as he wrote these stories. He found them very very funny and there are things in them that are funny,

4:35

but I don't know that many people would understand laughing so hard that your neighbors would complain. So there's something.

4:41

It's probably difficult to talk to a writer about the humor or

4:47

sadness or something in in his or her own work, because our sense of it tends to be very different from readers.

4:56

Interviewer: Yeah, but there was one interview you gave, Interviewer: Yeah, but there was one interview you gave, I forgot which media it was, but

5:03

you said, when you began writing, "Infinite Jest",

5:08

you wanted to write something about sadness. So sadness was something that really belonged to this project.

5:17

So, could you describe?

5:23

It was a while ago.

5:29

The easiest way to talk about it would be The easiest way to talk about it would be that for the upper-middle class

5:35

in the US, particularly younger people, things are often, materially, very comfortable.

5:42

And there's also often a great sadness and emptiness.

5:47

And it's difficult to think about and difficult to come up with answers in the abstract.

5:57

And I think I had started that book after a couple of people, not close friends,

6:04

but people I knew who were my age had committed suicide.

6:12

It just became obvious that something was going on.

6:18

And so I know that that impulse was part of starting the book.

6:25

The book is so long though, it took so long to write, that it's almost hard to remember the impulses at the beginning,

6:30

because everything sort of changes. It's something you live with for years and years,

6:35

rather than something that you just have an idea or a feeling, and you just do. I think one of the ideas in the book is that there's a particular

6:45

there's a particular ethos in U.S. culture, especially in entertainment and marketing culture.

6:52

That very much appeals to people as individuals, that you don't have to be devoted or subservient

6:59

to anything else. There is no larger good than your own good

7:04

and your own happiness. And in the book, as best I can recall,

7:11

Characters who become drug addicts - There is a form, that the root in English

7:17

of addict is the Latin, "addicere", which means

7:24

which means religious devotion. It was an attribute of beginning monks, I think.

7:30

There's an element in the book in which various people are

7:38

are living out something that, I think, is true, which is that we all worship and we all have a religious impulse.

7:46

We can choose to an extent what we worship, but the myth that we worship nothing

7:52

and give ourselves away to nothing simply sets us up to

7:57

give ourselves away to something different. For instance, pleasure or drugs.

8:05

or the idea of having a lot of money and being able to buy nice stuff or in the tennis academy,

8:12

it's somewhat different. It's devotion to an athletic pursuit that requires a certain amount of sacrifice and discipline,

8:20

but is nevertheless an individual sport and one is trying

8:26

to get ahead as an individual. I doubt this makes very much sense,

8:32

but whatever the conditions of hopelessness you're talking about,

8:38

at least in "Infinite Jest", have to do, I think,

8:44

with an American idea, and not a universal one, but one that I think kids get exposed to very early.

8:51

That you are the most important and what you want is the most important and that your job in life is to

8:58

gratify your own desires. That's a little crude to say it that way,

9:04

but in fact it's something of the ideology here.

9:11

And it's certainly the ideology that's perpetrated by television and advertising and entertainment

9:19

and the economy thrives on it. Interviewer: And what happens when this ideology becomes -- Sound Guy: Sorry, sorry.

9:26

Interviewer: Oh, was there ... Oh, am I? Oh, god, sorry. Sound Guy: I got to switch this battery out.

9:35

Shit, I was halfway lucid for a second there too. And it probably didn't come through? Sound Guy: No, it was fine.

9:41

I was feeling lucid. Sound Guy: I promise, it was fine. Sound Guy: Yeah, it went out for just the last question there. Yeah.

9:47

Sound Guy: But it's kind of hard because he moves in and out. I move in and out?

9:52

Sound Guy: Oh yeah. Interviewer: You know, the thing is the background is not too pretty. Interviewer: Of course, and that's why we're not showing --

9:57

I'm sorry. Interviewer and Sound Guy: No, no, no. That's cool. That's okay. Sound Guy: Because you're pontificating. Oh, thank you. There's a nice word.

10:04

Sound Guy: In a very deep, spiritual way. Thank you. Sound Guy: Okay? Which is completely screwing me.

10:10

[Laughter from Interviewer and Sound Guy] Sound Guy: Okay? That's a king. Sound Guy: You are, you're just, I can tell, you're very ...

10:18

Twitchy. I'm sorry? Sound Guy: You're very reflective. Well these are hard questions.

10:24

Particularly when it's about something you did seven years ago. Sound Guy: Okay. I just shoot the pictures. Yeah.

10:30

I would trade places with you at this moment. [Laughter] Sound Guy: Any time.

10:37

Interviewer: What do you think? Interviewer: What do you think? Does this ideology,

10:45

when children are told from the beginning everything that counts as your own happiness

10:51

and your own pursuit of satisfaction? Well, of course, nobody tells you.

10:59

I mean, mom and dad don't sit you down and say this. This is something very subtle

11:09

and is delivered by a great many messages.

11:20

Just conversationally, do you get what I'm talking about? I rather doubt that

11:27

European's idea of America is very different from this.

11:35

This is one enormous engine and temple of self-gratification and self-advancement.

11:42

And in some ways it works very very well. In other ways, it doesn't work all that well,

11:48

because, at least for me, it seems as if there are whole other parts of me

11:56

that need to worry about things larger than me

12:01

that don't get nourished in that system. Interviewer: And do you think the Europeans know that?

12:09

From the Europeans I've talked to, yeah.

12:14

When I get in arguments with Europeans it's that their view of it sort of exaggerated and simplistic.

12:21

It's a very complicated thing and full of paradoxes and ironies and all kinds of stuff.

12:29

And the idea that America is one great big shopping mall and that all anyone wants to do

12:37

is grasp their credit card and run out and buy stuff

12:42

is a stereotype and it's a generalization. But as a way to summarize a certain kind of ethos

12:50

in the U.S., it's pretty accurate. Particularly after the elections we just had on Tuesday.

12:58

The U.S. is not getting better in this area. It seems like it's getting worse. Interviewer: I've been coming here every year

13:03

Interviewer: I've been coming here every year over the last couple of years

13:10

and it seemed, for me, I seemed to see some progress in that.

13:15

This development. When you go to a department store, people seem more aggressive in trying to sell you stuff.

13:22

Yeah. Interviewer: On the other hand, I like it here

13:27

because, I mean, I'm German, it's not that funny too. It's not that what? Interviewer: Not that funny all the time too.

13:34

Yeah. Yeah. Interviewer: And also an intellectual crisis and everything. It stands still somehow.

13:40

There are certain paradoxes that go along with being a wealthy Western industrial country

13:49

and it just seems that they're probably somewhat common.

13:55

We have our race problems. You have the problems of absorbing East Germany

14:02

and dealing with all that stuff. I'll stay out of politics. It's too upsetting.

14:09

[laughter] Interviewer: What's also in this interview I read

14:14

you said you wanted to write something about a generation. I mean, you weren't sure

14:22

if you were right about this generation. But you somehow had that feeling that your generation was in that kind of trouble.

14:32

Well, my memory is, one of the reasons for setting the book in the future Well, my memory is, one of the reasons for setting the book in the future

14:39

was that ... I'm now 40, so I was born in the early 60s.

14:45

and to an extent, I think my generation tends to think of itself as children still

14:52

and as people with parents and I remember wanting to do

14:57

something about what would be the situation of our children. Kind of in the next generation.

15:04

Interviewer: And this child like thing also has something. There's one story

15:09

in "Interviews with Hideous Men", where the oppressed person is always talking about

15:16

the woman and the child. Is that something that belongs together? Or is this ...

15:25

Language like that, the wounded inner child, the inner pain is part of a kind of pop psychological movement

15:33

in the United States that is a sort of popular Freudianism that has its own paradox

15:42

which is that the more we are taught to list and resent the things of which

15:50

we were deprived as children, the more we live in that anger and frustration and the more we remain children.

15:57

That's a very simple way of putting it, but I think the character in that story is sort of a compendium of

16:03

kind of all the worst and most painful features of the popular psychology movement in the U.S.

16:11

And I don't know whether there's any analog to that in Western Europe or not. Interviewer: I think there is, actually.

16:19

And when you said that, I find that too, in Europe, that there is

16:26

this reluctance to really grow up and to live life on its terms.

16:34

What should this generation, which is not able to grow up, do about it?

16:42

Let me insert one thing, Let me insert one thing, which I'll bet you've noticed from talking to writers,

16:49

is that most of the stuff that we think we're writing about in books

16:54

is very difficult to talk about straight out. You know, question and answer.

17:00

In some sense, it probably can't be talked about directly, and that's why people make up stories about it. This is all a big defense,

17:06

because I feel like what I'm saying is so simple and so reductive

17:16

To the extent that I understand it, being what you call "grown-up"

17:23

isn't a lot of fun a lot of the time. There are things you have to do.

17:28

There are things you want to do, that you can't do for a variety of reasons.

17:35

I think, for young people in America there are very mixed messages from the culture.

17:42

There's a streak of moralism in American life There's a streak of moralism in American life that extols the virtues

17:47

of being grown up and having a family and being a responsible citizen, but there's also the sense of

17:54

do what you want, gratify your appetites, because when I'm a corporation,

18:00

appealing to the parts of you that are selfish and self-centered

18:05

and want to have fun all the time is the best way to sell you things. Right?

18:14

And the point that emerges from that is ...

18:24

is that it's, I think, one more example of the American ...

18:33

American economic and cultural systems that work very well

18:38

in terms of selling people products and keeping the economy thriving, do not work as well

18:45

when it comes to educating children or helping us help each other know how to live and be happy.

18:57

If that word means anything. Clearly it means something different from whatever I want to do.

19:03

I want to take this cup and throw it right now. I have every right to. I should. We see it with children. That's not happiness.

19:11

That feeling of having to obey every impulse and gratify every desire.

19:17

It seems to me to be a strange kind of slavery. Nobody talks about it as such though.

19:23

It talks about the freedom of choice and you have the right to have things

19:29

and spend this much money and you can have this stuff. Again, saying it this way, it sounds to me very crude and very simple,

19:37

but that's sort of the way.

19:46

Does this make ... does this make any sense to you? Interviewer: Absolutely. And I'm not lying or something. I would tell you. Interviewer: Absolutely. And I'm not lying or something. I would tell you.

19:51

But I mean, but you've spent time in the U.S.? Is this something - Interviewer: Yes. But I think it's not only a problem in the U.S.,

20:00

because everything, you know, that happens here is copied by people in Germany and there is always

20:07

this impulse that you only have to do what makes you happy and forget about all the others

20:14

and you don't want to be with boring people, people who need you. And that's not attractive and all that.

20:21

So it's more or less the same thing, so it makes sense to me of course. And it works very well as a system for And it works very well as a system for

20:27

running an economy and keeping goods produced and sold. It works wonderfully.

20:32

The ways in which it doesn't work are much more difficult to talk about.

20:41

Interviewer: So, speaking of that, where doesn't it work?

20:48

Once reduced to talking about general terms, Once reduced to talking about general terms, like being grown-up

21:00

or a term that's rarely used here anymore. And see, now I feel embarrassment,

21:06

because I'm going to sound like my grandfather or something. But the word, "citizen," the idea of being a citizen,

21:13

it would be to understand your country's history and the things about it that are good and not so good and how the system works

21:22

and taking the trouble to learn about candidates for political office, which means often reading stuff which isn't fun.

21:30

Sometimes it's boring.

21:35

But when people don't do that, here's what happens: the candidates win who have the most money to buy television advertisements,

21:43

because television advertisements are all most voters know about the candidates, therefore we get candidates who are beholden to large donors,

21:52

and become, in some ways, corrupt, which disgusts the voters

21:58

and makes the voters even less interested in politics, less willing to read and do the work of citizenship.

22:07

When I was a little boy, there was a class called "citizenship".

22:13

Here are certain things about America and America's history. Here's why it's important to vote.

22:19

Here's why it's important not to just go in and vote for who the best looking candidate is.

22:25

Here's what's really interesting, and I don't know if you can translate this. Talking about this now, I feel ashamed,

22:31

because my saying all this sounds to me like an older person saying this, like a person lecturing, which in American culture sets me up to be ridiculed.

22:40

It would be very easy to make fun of what I'm saying. It would be very easy to make fun of what I'm saying and I can hear in my head a voice making fun of this stuff as I'm saying it.

22:49

And this is the kind of paradox, I think,

22:54

of what it is to be a halfway intelligent American right now

23:00

and probably also a Western European. There are things we know are right and good

23:06

and would be better for us to do, but constantly it's like, yeah, but you know it's so much funnier and nicer to go do something else.

23:14

And who cares? And it's all bullshit anyway. Sorry. Interviewer: No, but it's the same dilemma actually in Germany, Interviewer: No, but it's the same dilemma actually in Germany,

23:22

when people are wanting to say something, knowing at the same time, it's this intellectual stereotype

23:28

but on the other hand, you kind of forget about it.

23:34

One of the things it causes is tension and unhappiness in people. One of the things it causes is tension and unhappiness in people.

23:41

I don't think it's very complicated and I don't think I've named the only reason for it. The paradox is that that sort of tension and complication

23:49

and conflict in people also makes them very easy to market to. Because I can say to you, 'Feeling uneasy? Life feels empty?'

23:59

'Well, here's something you can buy or something you can go do.'

24:06

The economics term is inelasticity of demand. I demand all the time, no matter what the price of it is.

24:13

And it works really well in an economic way.

24:19

Emotionally, spiritually, in terms of citizenship, in terms of feeling like a meaningful part, even of this country.

24:26

Forget the world. I'm sure the US government's

24:33

arrogance and disdain for the rest of the world is unpleasant, but it's also a natural extension of

24:42

certain cultural messages we send ourselves about ourselves that work very well in some ways

24:48

and make us very rich and very powerful. It's all complicated.

24:53

Interviewer: So we are all somehow addicted to having fun and even so-called serious literature ...

25:03

it's that you don't want to make this effort anymore. Books who are serious also have to be very entertaining

25:10

and you don't want to be bored. I think, twenty, thirty years ago, you can still read a book and

25:19

and it would be this kind of work to do, but you wouldn't think, well I have to be entertained all the time.

25:27

So how do we get out of this dilemma? Even for intellectuals, it has to be entertaining and not boring.

25:37

I don't know that ... I don't know that ... I don't know that I'd agree with the last part of what you said.

25:44

There's a real split, it's interesting that you went and interviewed Crichton, because there's a real split in U.S. literature

25:54

between commercial literature, novels like Crichton writes, Stephen King, Tom Clancy,

26:02

who are the other big ... Grisham. Some of which are really pretty good,

26:11

and they make a great deal of money and there's a whole lot of demand for them. And then there is still and I think it's probably like this in...

26:18

well, it's probably not quite ... There's probably more demand for serious books in Europe.

26:25

But here there's a small pocket of probably, I don't know, half a million...

26:33

say, a million readers, many of whom were from the upper classes

26:38

and have good educations and have been taught the pleasures of hard work in reading or music or art and like that.

26:51

I mean, when you're talking me, you're talking to somebody who doesn't have very much power in the culture

26:58

and who's not very important except in a fairly small I don't know what the analog would be.

27:04

It would be something like maybe contemporary classical music in the US, which there are people who enjoy it and listen to it,

27:11

partly because of training and partly because they are disposed to be willing to do a certain amount more work reading it.

27:18

But compared to popular music and rock and roll and hip-hop and stuff, classical music is nothing.

27:25

I mean, economically or commercially or in terms of how many people have heard of it

27:30

or how much an influence it has on the culture.

27:39

And, for me, personally, I don't know that it's really ever been all that different.

27:45

I think probably American education used to be a little bit better

27:50

and a little bit more difficult and children had no choice but to realize that there were certain things that were hard and involved a certain amount of drudgery

27:58

that were actually very satisfying at the end of it, but for the most part I think in the U.S., people who have been doing

28:05

"serious stuff" which is harder and stranger, have always played to a much smaller audience.

28:14

In terms of what can be done about the dilemma...

28:21

First of all, I'm wondering who would care what I think

28:27

and, second, I'm not sure, and, third, what do you think? I mean, you live in the same atmosphere I do.

28:33

Interviewer: Yeah, I think it's really a problem, of course. In Germany they have this TV literary expert

28:40

and he's called 'The Literary Pope'. So he's the Pope of Literature. And people think he has a very good view of everything and he really knows,

28:50

when he says, 'The book was good,' the book is good. Who is this guy? Interviewer: [Laughter] His name is Marcel Reich-Ranicki.

28:57

Maybe you've heard of him? Uh uh. And he's a very funny guy and he's maybe eight years old something

29:03

And he has always this verdict on the book, so the book is shit or ... He's part of your show? He's part of ...

29:10

Interviewer: No no no. But he is just a figure and at the same time

29:17

He always wants ... what he doesn't want the book to be is boring. By no means boring.

29:23

And at the same time he really understands a lot about books and he is really a good reader, but by saying all the time,

29:30

'Well, things are not supposed to be boring' ... I mean, I think that's really a mistake

29:36

and it's getting taken for granted and I feel sometimes I also have this feeling that I don't want to be bored

29:43

but at that the other side, I see that's not an option.

29:48

I mean, I don't know, you know, it's not right. I somehow have this feeling, even if it sounds stupid.

29:55

No. It's ... There's a difference though, I think, between being mildly bored There's a difference though, I think, between being mildly bored

30:01

but then there's another kind of boredom that I think you're talking about.

30:06

Reading requires sitting alone by yourself in a quiet room and I have friends, intelligent friends, who don't like to read,

30:14

because they get - it's not just bored - there's an almost dread that comes up, I think, here about having to be alone

30:26

and having to be quiet. And you see that when you walk into most public spaces in America.

30:31

It isn't quiet anymore. They pipe music through. And the music is easy to make fun of,

30:37

because it's usually horrible music, but it seems significant that we don't want things to be quiet ever anymore.

30:45

And to me, I don't know that I could defend it, but that seems to me to have something to do with

30:51

when you feel like the purpose of your life is to gratify yourself

30:56

and get things for yourself and go all the time, there's this other part of you

31:02

that's the same part that is almost hungry for silence and quiet

31:07

and thinking really hard about the same thing for maybe half an hour instead of thirty seconds

31:12

that doesn't get fed at all.

31:18

It makes itself felt in the body and a kind of dread in here.

31:23

I don't know whether that makes a lot of sense, but I think it's true that here in the U.S.,

31:29

every year the culture gets more and more hostile. I don't mean hostile like angry.

31:36

It becomes more and more difficult to ask people to read or to look at a piece of art for an hour

31:44

or to listen to a piece of music that's complicated and that takes work to understand,

31:50

because - well, there are a lot of reasons - but because, particularly now in computer and internet culture,

31:56

everything is so fast. And the faster things go, the more we feed that part of ourselves,

32:02

but don't feed the part of ourselves that likes ... that likes quiet. That can live in quiet.

32:11

That can live without any kind of stimulation. It's an American idiom, "Going to hell in a handbasket". It's an American idiom, "Going to hell in a handbasket".

32:17

Things are getting worse and worse and worse. When we're saying it, are we just saying exactly what people our age said a hundred years ago?

32:25

There's no way ever to know how different we are. Things seems different.

32:31

Interviewer: Yeah, you never get this distance to yourself to really know.

32:43

Now I don't know what I wanted to ask anymore.

32:49

So, there was an episode in "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men",

32:54

where it was also about this depressed person -- You like talking about this story, don't you?

33:02

Interviewer: Yeah, I do, actually. No, it's alright. Interviewer: [Laughter] Is that bad? No, it's fine.

33:07

Interviewer: And there was something I read that happens to me very often. I have a friend and she has multiple sclerosis.

33:15

Yeah. Interviewer: And that's a very bad thing for a young woman. That's no fun. Interviewer: No, definitely. And she calls me

33:22

and as soon as I pick up the phone she instantly begins

33:28

to talk about her sickness and what she takes and about going to the hospital.

33:33

Now is this part going to make it on to the interview? Are we going to hear this part? Interviewer: No. No. Okay. That's what I figured. Alright. Keep going.

33:39

[Camera man and interviewer laugh] Keep going. Interviewer: Everything I say is not going to make it on anyway. Fine. Okay.

33:44

Interviewer: Don't worry about that. Great. Great... Great great great great. [Camera man and Interviewer derisively laugh at David]

33:50

Interviewer: But I thought you wanted to have a conversation? Yes. Yes. No, this is fine. I'm just wishing - this is good.

33:55

Camera Man: I mean, they can hear, but it's not making it to the show. [Interviewer continues cackling] Alright.

34:00

Interviewer: So, so, she calls me, and in the moment I hear her, I think, oh shit, okay, okay.

34:07

The next couple of hours are gone, because she's telling me all that stuff. And on one hand, I know she has really got to get that out

34:15

and it's somehow my duty, because I like her, to hear that. But on the other side, I think of my own free time

34:23

and I thought, well, I was just sitting here and now I have to hear all that stuff.

34:28

And afterwards, when it's over, I think, well, it's good that I ... you know. Yeah.

34:34

Imagine though, if she called you up, late at night, and talked to you for two hours and it was mostly apologizing for bothering you.

34:41

So that it's just one more layer of frosting, which is just something that goes along with kind of a depressive temperament.

34:47

So there's a lot of narcissism in self-hatred. Interviewer: Yeah, but what I was thinking is what is so bad about me?

34:55

What's wrong with me? That I hear her name and I think, oh shit, again.

35:01

That happened to me. I shouldn't have picked up the phone. And that's, you know, that's also part of the problem.

35:06

Because, on the other hand, that is something I have to do.

35:13

Yeah, but it's also. I mean, it's not ... Well, no. Now we're in this conversation

35:18

and I'm going to be talking about your specific thing. This doesn't get used, right? No, but it's just kind of ...

35:25

I don't think you're a bad person for ... I have a friend, who's not sick,

35:31

but lost her mother, sister, father, to cancer, all within three years. And then her best friend died of AIDS in San Francisco.

35:38

This woman had the most terrible two or three years of anybody I've ever heard of.

35:43

Pretty good friend of mine. My heart would sink every time ... because it was always painful.

35:50

And she didn't complain about it. You know, she was she was doing real good, but still I like things to be pleasant.

35:56

I'd rather drink my chocolate milk and read a comic book than hear about unpleasant stuff.

36:02

But this ... The depressed person lady just has another has another spin on that.

36:11

which is that she's so worried about that feeling you have of dread

36:17

that she's calling, that she's going to try to get in there, and hate herself for it before you can and there's a great deal more narcissism in her.

36:25

I didn't like her very much. Interviewer: Yeah, I have a feeling ... It's usually really bad not to like the main character of a story.

36:33

And I haven't done many where I didn't, but this one I didn't like. So it's just why I smiled.

36:39

Everybody asked me about the story and it's like the one I don't want to talk about. But it's fine. It's fine.

36:44

Interviewer: No, no. I also found that he didn't like her, but nevertheless the story is -- But she didn't like herself either. So.

36:51

She would've predicted that I didn't like her. Interviewer: Right. [Chuckles uncomfortably] So um.

36:58

So um, do you still, I mean, do you watch TV? So um, do you still, I mean, do you watch TV? I don't have a TV.

37:04

Because if I have a TV, I will watch it all the time. So there's my little confession about how strong I am at resisting stuff.

37:12

I watch TV over at friends houses and stuff sometimes. I don't watch as much as I used to. Interviewer: Yeah, but in "Infinite Jest", the entertainment is not Interviewer: Yeah, but in "Infinite Jest", the entertainment is not

37:22

coming from TV, directly, but it's coming from the noise.

37:27

I thought more from those cartridges that you order and get all the time.

37:34

But is the entertainment in "Infinite Jest" like TV as in America today?

37:40

Is it somehow similar? I don't know what you mean by TV. I don't know what you mean by TV.

37:46

There's network TV and there's cable TV and there's satellite TV where we can get 500 channels.

37:53

Then there are movies and various things available on both tape and DVD

37:58

and so the phenomenon of TV, the stuff you can look at when looking at a TV

38:04

is probably not all that dissimilar. My memory in "Infinite Jest" is that there was some complicated

38:10

setup where they would sometimes broadcast things and then sometimes deliver it to you on a cartridge.

38:17

You would have to let me go look. I don't remember very well. Interviewer: Yeah, that's right. There are things about the book that are probably not

38:24

economically all that realistic. Interviewer: Yeah, but, I mean, it's, just, I mean, um, yeah.

38:33

It seemed to me that all the people in the book wanted to reach a similar state of mind,

38:40

like something, like amnesia, if people were doing drugs and people who are using the entertainment

38:48

and there was one woman who did something to herself

38:54

and she said I didn't want to hurt me, but I didn't want to get hurt anymore.

38:59

I just wanted all this stuff to stop. Is this a similar something - is this a similar goal

39:07

which people want you to reach about in similar ways?

39:14

Sort of amnesia or self-forgetting? Sure, I guess.

39:23

Part of the allure of both drugs and entertainment Part of the allure of both drugs and entertainment

39:28

is escape from my problems and my life and having to be stuck in here.

39:35

I can pretend I'm James Bond or someone. It just seems fine over the short haul.

39:42

As a way of life, it doesn't work all that well though, no?

39:47

Interviewer: No, but in your book - I don't ... Interviewer: There are a lot of people doing drugs.

39:56

Not have to feel those things anymore. Yeah, well, stop me if I'm wrong, but...

40:04

Because again, like I said, you know I did this thing like seven years ago. Interviewer: You just say what you think about it.

40:09

Um, no. I don't quite get the question, because it seems to me the parts of the book that have to do with drugs

40:16

have mostly to do with this halfway house where people who have been doing drugs for ten years

40:21

kind of stop and then sort of lose their minds because all of a sudden now they are starting to feel some of this stuff.

40:30

So, if you're talking about the more general allure of drugs So, if you're talking about the more general allure of drugs to the extent that I understand it,

40:36

which is about as specifically as I'm going to talk about it,

40:42

It seems to me to be, and this isn't a very original thing to say, it's a pretty natural extension of corporate capitalist logic,

40:50

which is, I want to feel exactly the way I want to feel, which is good for exactly this long

40:55

and so I will exchange a certain amount of cash for this substance And I will do it, but it's all of course a lie,

41:03

because the control gradually goes away and it stops being that I want to do it,

41:08

it becomes that I feel I need to do it and that shift from, I want something, to, I feel I need it, is a big one.

41:16

Yes? I mean ... Most of the problems in my life have to do with my confusing what I want and what I need.

41:25

Interviewer: I was just having this very, Interviewer: I was just having this very, I have to admit, very simplistic notion.

41:33

Interviewer: What we want to reach, what most people want to reach is this state of flawlessness,

41:41

not having to think anymore. And I just wanted to know if there are several ways

41:48

to reach this state of mind and, you know, watching entertainment all the time and ...

41:54

Are you talking about entertainment in general or the entertainment in the book? Interviewer: In the book and also

42:00

when I turn the TV on here it really drives me crazy because it's always, I see a little piece, and then it's commercial break,

42:07

and then they show me something and then I'm supposed to watch the longer part, but I've already seen the longer part,

42:13

so there's no use in doing that. So it drives me somehow mad. Yeah. Interviewer: This all creates this kind of state of

42:19

if I do it every day and so now it may be ... Well, particularly if you have a remote control. Well, particularly if you have a remote control.

42:25

See, when that happens, you go to a different channel and if you don't like that channel, you go to a different channel. And one of the reasons I can't own a TV

42:32

is I've started having this thing where I become convinced there's something really good on another channel and that I'm missing it.

42:37

And so instead of watching, I'm scanning anxiously back and forth for this thing that I think I want, that I don't even know what it is.

42:45

And so, I don't know whether German ... Well, this is probably not a good thing to say on television, but I don't know whether a similar thing happens in Germany,

42:52

but it's very stressful now. And what it is, is too much good stuff combined with my sick little head

42:58

that thinks there's always something a little better on the next ... And all you have to do. You don't have to get up now to change it.

43:05

That was the problem, when it became easy. You just had to move your thumb and change it.

43:10

That's when we were screwed. Interviewer: So do you think it's ...

43:15

Ninety-percent of this is going to be cut out, right? Interviewer: Yeah, sure. Yes? Okay. [Awkward interviewer laughter]

43:21

Interviewer: I mean, not because I like it, Interviewer: I mean, not because I like it, but because, you know -- Because it's not going to make any sense. Yes, right. Right.

43:27

Interviewer: Yeah. So, do you think that entertainment... Is entertainment something we have to fight against?

43:38

See, it's a strange question, See, it's a strange question, because who would say entertainment is bad? I mean, I wouldn't say entertainment is bad.

43:48

But a model of life in which

43:54

I have a right to be entertained all the time seems to me not to be a promising one. Right?

44:07

And this won't translate, but of course one of the insidious about it is that

44:13

entertainment is so god damn entertaining. Imagine this show were running on American TV

44:20

and I were sitting in this hotel watching it. Okay, we get this pointy-headed nerdy guy talking about this stuff or I've got, you know, Pamela Anderson running on a beach

44:29

or hilarious comedy. Which one am I going to watch? You know, there's no ...

44:37

If fighting against entertainment is even required, how does one do it, unless

44:45

Well, there are two options: One is you direct the attack only to people who are willing to listen to the complexity.

44:52

But those aren't the people who are enslaved by entertainment anyway. Or you find some way to make the attack on entertainment entertaining

45:00

in which case you've been captured by the very thing you're fighting against. It's very very strange. Interviewer: Yeah, that's exactly the dilemma.

45:07

Yes. Interviewer: That's exactly it.

45:15

This is different, the topic is different now. "Infinite Jest" takes place in a tennis academy

45:25

and you have been, I read, a tennis player. A quite good tennis player.

45:32

A somewhat good tennis player, not a quite good ... No, I played a lot as a kid. Yes.

45:37

Interviewer: And then you said once, 'Well tennis was a little bit like chess and like boxing.'

45:45

I don't know if it's a combination of the two. But you somehow related the three together, tennis, boxing, and chess.

45:52

What makes tennis so special? Well, if you're asking why it's in the book,

46:00

the reason it's in the book is it's the one sport I knew well enough to be able to try to talk about why it was beautiful.

46:07

And it's also a sport that has to do with two very bounded spaces and sending stuff back and forth between them

46:13

which has other stuff to do with the book. I think tennis is a very very beautiful sport,

46:21

because it's very abstract and geometrical and tactical like chess.

46:27

And it's also very physical. There's a lot of running. You get very tired playing.

46:33

I don't know about the boxing thing unless that it's just usually one person against another person.

46:38

Interviewer: And chess? Well, if you're really interested,

46:46

really good tennis players, like really good chess players, are always thinking four or five moves ahead.

46:53

Actually, this was something that ...

46:59

that some of the German players who were superstars in the nineties were very good at doing.

47:06

Boris Becker didn't just come up and hit an ace. What Boris Becker - and I think he'd learned this from McEnroe -

47:13

was really good at hitting the forcing serve that made you hit a weak return that let him come into the net and put the next shot away.

47:21

So that everything is being thought of ahead, but it's also very combative.

47:27

But if you and I are playing, if I win, you lose. I'm trying to beat you very individually.

47:32

I don't feel like this is making any sense at all. Interviewer: It does. Okay. Okay. Interviewer: I'm sorry, but - No, no. Okay, fine.

47:39

Well, you can run some sort of editing magic. Interviewer: Yeah, sure, but I don't have to.

47:44

But there's also something about - It's also combat at a distance. In boxing, the two bodies are very close to each other.

47:52

There's something a little colder about tennis, which is, I'm trying to beat you,

47:58

but you're 75 feet away from me and what's traveling between us is just this small thing.

48:03

There's something more abstract about it which is a little bit more like chess. Interviewer: And you also said it's more mathematical, right?

48:11

There was ... I think there was ... Are you talking about the essay that talks about calculus and tennis?

48:20

Interviewer: No. Maybe I didn't understand it, Hal talks - no, was it Mario who talks to this guy?

48:30

His name is Schtitt? Schtitt! Schtitt? Yeah. I think he says that.

48:36

A German, as I recall. Interviewer: Yeah. But that's not a German name, actually. No, of course it isn't.

48:41

What it is, is a vaguely Germanic sounding name to Americans. Yeah, he's not the subtlest character in there.

48:52

Well, the angles are mathematical. So I don't know.

48:59

Interviewer: So, what is literature able to do that other - Interviewer: So, what is literature able to do that other -

49:04

I saw this on the sheet of paper. Interviewer: Yeah, because I had to ... Good. Good. So let me ask you first, and then I'll ...

49:11

What is it that literature can do that other things can't do? It's not so easy, is it?

49:18

Interviewer: No, no. Not at all. But I thought that, you know, you're more intelligent than I am.

49:27

Well, actually, I read in this interview and you said something,

49:34

That good art somehow is able to not make you feel alone.

49:41

That is something actually that I'm very addicted to. Because, simple as I am, I'm very happy

49:51

when I don't feel so lonesome when I read something. And also, good literature?

50:00

Literature is something very musical to me. I had that with Bernhard very much,

50:05

because the sicker he got in his life, the easier the words became.

50:12

And it was like some kind of music. So, for me, the beauty of the words and also this musical thing about it,

50:20

and also something philosophical and not feeling alone. Why don't - can we just put that in?

50:27

That's a better answer to the question than I could have given. Interviewer: No, no. First I had to answer.

50:34

Well, play back the tape of what she said, and I'll just - no.

50:42

It's a heavy question.

50:50

There's something musical about it, because it has to do with patterns of meaning that develop over time.

50:59

There's stuff, for me, about reading that isn't like looking at a piece of art,

51:07

because, there, I choose how long I look and what I look at. I'm being directed through a linear flow of time.

51:13

But in a piece of music or in a movie, that flow is directed for me. I've really got no choice, but to follow it.

51:19

Whereas books, it's weird. I'm moving through time, through this thing,

51:25

but I can also, I don't know whether you do it or not, but if I've read a paragraph I like a lot, I go back and I read it over again.

51:32

So I'm trapped in time, but I've got more mobility within that time.

51:37

And then I think ... There's other writers I've talked to about this

51:45

and most of us who end up doing this like to read as kids, probably for the same reason you did.

51:53

I'm trying to think of a way to say it where it doesn't just sound stupid and simple, but it goes without saying that ...

52:02

There are four of us in this room. I'm sure we all seem fairly pleasant.

52:09

There are big limits on what we'll ever know Like I don't know what's in your mind, right now.

52:15

God knows I don't know what's in his mind right now. There's a way for me - I'm talking more as a reader -

52:22

that when I'm reading something that's good and that's real I'm able to jump over that wall of self

52:33

and inhabit somebody else in a way that I can't. You know, that we can't in regular life.

52:42

And when I do inhabit that other person, very often what they're thinking or saying or feeling are things very much the way I do,

52:51

but I'm scared there's something wrong with me that I do and nobody else does. There's a tremendous reassurance about that kind of

53:00

communion and empathy. And then it gets more complicated,

53:05

because I'm also getting access to the mind of the author in a way that we don't have access to each other talking this way.

53:17

Most of the friends I've got, and most of my friends don't like to read. Most of the friends I've got who don't like to read

53:22

find it, A) boring, and B) just kind of lonely and slow. And I just don't get it.

53:27

because watching television for me, although it's easier, is much lonelier. Watching in flat images on a flat screen doing interesting things

53:36

and often they're very easy to look at is very different from knowing what it's like to be inside somebody else's skin

53:44

or knowing what it's like to be able to spend two hours with an author who somehow can make me feel like I know what it is.

53:51

I mean, it just seems like a form of magic to me. Interviewer: And is it also comfort?

53:59

I can't remember which American writer it was ... I heard him speaking.

54:04

He said that his job is to comfort the disturbed and to disturb the comfortable.

54:10

And so that, there's something comforting ...

54:15

There's something comforting about being able to inhabit somebody else, but there's something also very uncomfortable about it,

54:22

because usually the experiences that person is having are just the ones that I don't like

54:28

or that I haven't worked out. And it seems to me that the biggest split isn't

54:34

between music and literature or music and sculpture, whatever. They're forms of art that offer us escapes from ourselves and our daily lives.

54:42

And I think that's fun in small doses. And then there are kinds of art that offer us more confrontation

54:49

with our own lives. I don't think it's surprising that there isn't as much demand

54:55

or as much money in the latter, because it's more difficult and less pleasant sometimes.

55:01

It takes skill and education to get good enough at reading or listening

55:06

to be able to derive pleasure from it. There's class stuff involved here that gets very tricky.

55:15

But I think it's worthwhile. I think reading and writing are both worthwhile.

55:21

That's very profound. [Laughter] I did good for awhile in the middle there. That was lucid.

55:28

All I did was parrot back what you said - Interviewer: No, you didn't. But I took like ten times as long And I did this [hand gestures] a lot more.

55:39

Boy, is it hot in here now. Interviewer: Yes, it is. [Laughter] Camera Man: Oh yeah.

55:46

Interviewer: So we are right into something that I actually have ... Do you want me to get you some water or something?

55:53

No, I'm fine. I'll just be sweating here in my chair. It's fine. Not a problem. Interviewer: The typical American.

55:59

Yes, the sweaty American. I'm proud to sweat on behalf of the USA. [Laughter]

56:06

Interviewer: So we were just in the middle of a question that I put on this paper

56:11

which was somehow faxed. And which I received. Interviewer: That's good to know.

56:20

The fear of the writer. That his work and his persona, somehow, made banal, be flattened, and abused,

56:29

as soon as the media - I don't recall that. Where's that written down there? Interviewer: Here. Banal?

56:34

Interviewer: Yeah, I don't know if that's - Oh. Okay. Interviewer: "Banalized". I think I made this word up? How interesting.

56:40

See, mine stopped here. Interviewer: Really? Yeah. There wasn't any of this stuff. Interviewer: Oh my God. No, it's fine.

56:51

So, we're talking about the marketing of writing stuff? Interviewer: No, but. I mean ...

56:57

The fear of the writer that his work and his persona are somehow made into banal, well not only, but, it belongs to promoting.

57:09

The work and his persona are the same thing? Interviewer: No, no, no. But they're both made ...

57:16

Interviewer: Yeah, but, you know, when you're out there for the media.

57:22

What happens then? I see a paradox here. I'm going to talk about the difficulties

57:28

of having to deal with the media, but I'm talking to the media. See, I'll pretend I'm talking to you,

57:34

but when this shows, you're going to have this face, sweaty face, on camera, talking about how difficult it is, as a writer, to be on camera,

57:43

in which case, if I were the viewer, I would go, 'So why is the son of a bitch on camera?'

57:48

So, how do you suggest I handle this? Interviewer: Yeah. No. It's a paradox, but at the same time I think it's very ...

57:55

I mean, it's a legitimate fear to have.

58:00

I think about these things all the time. I think, well, I like literature, but at the same time,

58:05

why am I doing this? And how am I doing this? And how can I try to preserve these things?

58:12

So, you know, it's a paradox for me too.

58:17

So, for this reason I think it's something you can think about. Sure.

58:24

Well, there are a number of trade-offs. In the United States, there's another division between corporate publishers

58:34

and non-profit publishers, who are often very small and do a lot of poetry and avant-garde fiction.

58:40

If you are "lucky", these are square quotes, if you are lucky enough to be published by a corporate publisher,

58:49

you get more exposure, you get reviewed in the New York Times instead of just your local newspaper,

58:58

you get translated into other languages.

59:04

But literary stuff loses money for corporate publishers almost all the time. And one of the ways they try to keep from losing money is marketing this stuff.

59:14

And for reasons that everyone has tried to explain to me, but I still don't understand it,

59:20

having the author go around and talk and read - The thing they most like to do is send you to a bookstore

59:27

and you give a reading at a bookstore and there's maybe 200 people there, but, while you're in town to do the reading for the bookstore,

59:34

you talk to the local newspaper and you maybe do something like this. And that generates free advertising for the book.

59:48

My problems with it are the following: my stuff, I don't feel like, is meant to be read out loud.

59:56

It's not supposed to live on the breath. There isn't enough punctuation in it.

1:00:02

And I don't feel like I read it out loud very well, A). And B) , I find ...

1:00:13

When there's a question and answer, like you and I are having, although you and I are having a much more lengthy one,

1:00:21

but particularly with a newspaper reporter or a question-and-answer at the end of a reading,

1:00:29

the question is easy to answer if it's dull or stupid. The good questions are questions that can't be answered

1:00:36

in a Q-and-A format, right? They're ones where you would have to sit down with a pot of tea or a pot of coffee.

1:00:42

There are things that can be answered only in conversation between two people. And so I always feel vaguely

1:00:51

fraudulent. There's a thing about doing this where you're helping me.

1:00:57

We're pretending we're having a conversation. And I'm also pretending that there aren't cameras all over here,

1:01:03

but in fact this is all on TV, and I know that I'm supposed to ignore, I'm not supposed to look at the camera,

1:01:08

because that doesn't make for a good interview. But trust me, when I'm sitting here, the camera is the thing I really see.

1:01:15

It's all very strange. And so ... So why do I do it at all?

1:01:21

I make a variety of deals. And I do a few things.

1:01:26

I know some writers who like this. And there are things about it - it's very flattering.

1:01:33

You guys came. It makes me nervous and it makes me ...

1:01:41

it makes me self-conscious to try to talk about stuff that I find almost impossible to talk about. Or else just to go, 'So, how long are you in town?' 'Oh, three days.'

1:01:56

But I have an agent whom I owe 25,000 favors to. He's done all of these nice things for me.

1:02:02

And it's also exciting for a writer to get his work published in another country, so she says.

1:02:10

This German publisher is really good.

1:02:15

They're going to publish the book well, even though I don't think my English can really be translated into German

1:02:21

because it's very idiomatic. Great advertisement, I'm sure.

1:02:30

And all they need, they need this one thing from you to help them sell enough books

1:02:36

maybe so that they don't lose money on it. It then becomes very difficult to say, no.

1:02:41

On the other hand, I don't think it's very good, I don't think it's good. Maybe a show like this?

1:02:49

There's no analog for this in the U.S., but the whole going around and reading in bookstores thing,

1:02:55

it's turning writers into kind of penny-ante or cheap versions of celebrities.

1:03:03

People aren't usually coming out to hear you read, they're coming out to see what you look like

1:03:09

and see whether your voice matches the voices in their head when they read. And none of it's important.

1:03:14

It's icky. I don't know if there's a German translation for "icky".

1:03:20

In terms of "banal", I don't know. "Banal", to me, means,

1:03:26

general and simplistic and superficial and vapid.

1:03:34

If you do work like this, you pay certain prices. You don't make as much money. Not as many people read your stuff.

1:03:40

But people who are reading it and are interested in it, you're pretty sure ...

1:03:45

The thing that I like about doing this kind of stuff is that I'm pretty sure my readers are about as smart as I am.

1:03:51

I think if you're somebody like Crichton or someone who's a Harvard M.D., but you're writing for a mass audience,

1:03:57

things get very strange. I don't worry that people who are reading my stuff are misunderstanding it.

1:04:05

Or "banalizing" it any more than it's already banal.

1:04:11

I do worry, weirdly, about when it's translated into languages that I don't know.

1:04:17

I worry that I don't know what's in there. There are so many American idioms in there

1:04:24

that I don't know whether they can be translated or not. Interviewer: That's very hard to do, to translate it, actually.

1:04:31

The people who did it, who translated your work in German, are really people who are very much into it, you know.

1:04:39

I know some of them. Oh, no. I mean, that's good to hear. And you can understand, I can believe you,

1:04:45

and still, there's this weird ... there's this weird ... Because, one of the things about ...

1:04:51

You're probably like this about your work too. The term is, "control-freak". You know, I want to control every single word that's on there.

1:05:00

And so, it's just tough. The one language I can read, I read the translation,

1:05:06

and it was just so different from anything I meant, that I've decided that it was just better

1:05:12

to have it be done in languages I don't know. Is that any kind of answer to the question?

1:05:18

Interviewer: Yeah, sure. Sure. One thing that also very much appealed to me One thing that also very much appealed to me

1:05:26

is when you spoke in an interview about existential loneliness.

1:05:34

I said the word, "existential loneliness"? Interviewer: Yeah. Something like that. Okay.

1:05:39

Interviewer: You know, I'm German. Somethings I get things right and wrong. No, no, no. Okay ...

1:05:47

Interviewer: And that's something very much I like to hear an author say, because, in the things I read, that's one thing I'm searching for,

1:05:59

these testimonies of existential loneliness. So, is that something you still relate to? Or ...

1:06:08

Well, yeah. If I understand your question, this is the stuff we were talking about two questions ago.

1:06:14

There's something painful about being stuck in a body and a consciousness that can't ever, except through conversation,

1:06:23

can't ever be inside anybody else's. And there is a magic about ...

1:06:29

Except, see, I don't know that much about music. People who do say that there is a purity with which

1:06:35

the composer's emotional state can be felt by the listener that can't be approached by anything else either.

1:06:40

Probably, most of kinds of art have this magical thing of, for a moment, there's a kind of reconciliation and communion

1:06:50

between you and me that isn't possible in any other way.

1:06:55

But it's also the sort of thing that's so weighty and so general, that, especially after he used the word, "pontificate", I feel ...

1:07:03

Interviewer: What does it mean? I have never heard it. The word, "pontificate"? To speak pompously about very complex abstruse matters.

1:07:12

It's a little bit pejorative. But he meant it in a funny way. But it's, I mean, it's ...

1:07:17

This is something else about being an American. When I hear the word, "existential", now,

1:07:23

half of me rolls my eyes, 'Oh, what a big sexy philosophical term.'

1:07:29

And it becomes hard to speak seriously about it, because all I can hear is being made fun of

1:07:37

for how serious and boring and dull I'm being. If that makes any sense. Good luck editing.

1:07:42

Camera Man: We're switching tapes. You're German accent's much better than mine. How surprising.

1:07:47

Interviewer: Yeah, really.

1:07:57

Interviewer: In Germany, when I'm talking about my generation,

1:08:02

people in my profession, most of the time they have really good educations,

1:08:11

and all this. There's also the feeling of not being able to do anything with it.

1:08:21

You have pretty good conditions to start with, and then after that you think, well, what's next?

1:08:28

What am I doing with this? Maybe it's not reality, but you have the feeling of not doing anything with your life.

1:08:40

And what do you think about that? I know that there's a paradox in the U.S. of,

1:08:50

the people who get powerful jobs, tend to go to really good schools,

1:08:57

and often in school you study the liberal arts, philosophy, classical stuff, languages.

1:09:02

And it's all very much about the nobility of the human spirit and broadening the mind.

1:09:08

And from that, you go to a specialized school to learn how to sue people

1:09:15

or to figure out how to write copy that will make people buy a certain kind of SUV. And yeah ...

1:09:31

I don't know what I think about it other than that ...

1:09:39

I'm not sure really that it's ever been all that different. I'm not sure really that it's ever been all that different.

1:09:47

because very few of us, and there are things about my job I don't like,

1:09:53

but this is one of them that I do like, is that I get to use ...

1:09:59

I get to use pretty much everything I've ever learned or think about. It's actually something that goes a long way when I bitch and moan.

1:10:09

Sometimes it's lonely work and sometimes you worry it's not very good. I know that there is, at least in America,

1:10:16

an entire class of, and now, I'm talking about a very specific class here, I'm talking about upper and upper-middle-class kids

1:10:25

whose parents could afford to send them to very good schools where they got very good educations,

1:10:31

who are often working in jobs that are financially rewarding,

1:10:38

but don't have anything to do with what they got persuasively taught

1:10:43

was important and worthwhile in school. And that is - I've never taught about it in those stark terms -

1:10:51

that's a bit of a paradox, isn't it? When you guys talk about it, what do you conclude from it?

1:10:58

Interviewer: That's the thing, I don't know what to conclude from it.

1:11:03

I don't know if it's a phenomenon that has to do with a certain generation.

1:11:11

A friend of yours, your age, who you were in school with, who's a business man now, would say that you are better off than he,

1:11:18

because you're at least getting to use a lot of the stuff that you studied in your actual work, right?

1:11:23

Interviewer: Right. You know what? We could talk about it for a long time.

1:11:31

I don't know that I could say anything about it that would be interesting.

1:11:36

From an on-camera point of view, my suspicion is that this has got something to do with

1:11:44

with something that was explained by original sin, in Genesis, which is that,

1:11:51

as we get older, we have to do things to get money, to stay alive, and there are things about that that often feel very wrong to us.

1:12:07

It would be very nice if you cut that out, because that just sounds weird.

1:12:13

I don't know. Interviewer: Maybe this alienation is just part of it, you know?

1:12:19

In your book, in "Infinite Jest", there are also people who,

1:12:25

they don't want to grow up. And they feel alienated from what they started.

1:12:32

And they say, well, we have done this and that. Well, we're not talking a Marxist alienation.

1:12:39

We're not talking about alienation from the means of production.

1:12:46

The thing of it is, though, at least in the U.S., this would be my guess, I doubt that somebody who went only to high school,

1:12:55

which is the secondary school, and is working in a factory,

1:13:01

I doubt he wakes up and goes, 'Well, by gosh, at least I don't have all this humanistic learning I'm not using.'

1:13:07

I don't imagine he's any more satisfied

1:13:13

or nourished inside by his job either. What you and I are part of is a class and generation that can be very articulate

1:13:21

about what our complaints are and what we're feeling uneasy about. I think if there's something that characterizes our generation,

1:13:29

is not that we've come up with new problems or brilliant new solutions to them, but that we're endlessly verbal about it.

1:13:37

Which is probably a start, at least being able to talk about it.

1:13:46

Interviewer: Talking about this dilemma,

1:13:52

wanting to be entertained and you just mentioned there was this big thing in America, a couple of days ago,

1:14:04

and also this movement in a certain direction. And you asked me what I thought it was in ten, twenty years from now.

1:14:11

So what do you think it will be like in a couple of decades from now in America?

1:14:20

I mean, how will this go on? I don't know. I don't know. I'm scared.

1:14:30

I don't know that I could say anything about the last couple years that anybody else couldn't say.

1:14:46

When I was younger, I used to ... When I was younger, I used to ...

1:14:51

There's a way in which we in America are very comfortable.

1:14:57

And I used to think that some of the political and social answers

1:15:05

that I thought should be ...

1:15:10

Some of the political and social corrections that I thought should be brought about would happen when there was some sort of cataclysm

1:15:17

or misfortune, where we weren't as comfortable any more.

1:15:24

The fact that ... that we now have clear evidence that the way we live

1:15:33

and the relationships we have with various other countries

1:15:39

are causing some people to hate us so much that they want to kill us,

1:15:45

and may succeed in killing a great many of us, frightens me only because ...

1:15:58

When I was growing up, one of the mythological periods for us growing up is the Great Depression.

1:16:07

Weimar era. Where the story goes, everyone pulled together.

1:16:12

There were hard times, and no one had enough, but everyone pulled together.

1:16:18

It seems to me now, that the country's reaction to feeling frightened and insecure

1:16:27

is to buy Sports Utility Vehicles that are large and massive and tank-like and make individual people feel safer,

1:16:34

but also get four miles-to-the-gallon in a country where gasoline is probably one-fifth as expensive as it ought to be.

1:16:44

There's a sanity in Europe about gasoline prices and fuel consumption that there isn't here yet.

1:16:50

And yet, are voting for people who are deciding to go over and very possibly kill hundreds of thousands of civilians

1:17:00

in order to kill a few enemies. None of which is important, but the fact that no one here is talking about the connection between

1:17:09

how we live and what we drive

1:17:14

and the things that are happening. The speed with which it's become, those bad people, those bad fanatics, they're evil,

1:17:23

what they really hate is our freedom and our way of life, which is just hard to swallow, right? Who hates freedom?

1:17:29

People hate people, not freedom.

1:17:37

I now don't know what's going to happen. And I am, as an American, as scared ...

1:17:47

Not since I was a little boy and I worried about the U.S. and the Soviet Union having an intercontinental -

1:17:53

Not since that, have I been this scared. And this is totally personally, but I'm more scared of us

1:18:01

than I am of anybody else. That's a bleak place to be. I'm not sure how I feel about ...

1:18:08

Well, you're going to use it if you want. I don't think this is an evil country.

1:18:14

I don't think American people are evil. I think we've had it very ... I think we've had it very easy, materially, for a long time,

1:18:22

and we've gotten very little help in understanding things that are important besides being comfortable.

1:18:29

I don't think anybody knows how we will react if things get really hard here.

1:18:36

The fact that we're strong militarily and economically is a good thing, but it's also a frightening thing.

1:18:44

To some of us, as Americans.

1:18:51

Luckily, not a lot of Americans will see this in Germany.

1:18:56

Interviewer: Are there any means of rebellion? Interviewer: Are there any means of rebellion?

1:19:01

Sure. Interviewer: So, what would it be?

1:19:08

Well, there are people doing it all over the place.

1:19:14

I don't know about people rappelling down buildings and getting tear gassed and stuff.

1:19:22

The people I know who are rebelling meaningfully don't buy a lot of stuff.

1:19:31

And don't get their view of the world from television.

1:19:36

And are willing to spend four or five hours researching an election rather than going by commercials.

1:19:43

The thing about it is that in America, we think of rebellion as this very sexy thing

1:19:48

and it involves action and force and looks good. My guess is the forms of rebellion that will end up changing anything meaningfully here

1:19:57

will be very quiet and very individual. And probably not all that interesting to look at from the outside.

1:20:05

I'm now hoping for less interesting, rather than more interesting. Violence is interesting

1:20:12

and horrible corruption and scandals and rattling sabers and talking about war

1:20:18

and demonizing a billion people of a different faith in the world. Those are all interesting. Sitting in a chair and really thinking about what this means

1:20:26

and why the fact that what I drive might have something to do with how people in other parts of the world feel about me

1:20:34

isn't interesting to anybody else. That was very close to the truth, but I don't think it's going to make much sense.

1:20:40

And plus, it's a little silly. I'm a writer. I'm not a politician or a political thinker or whatever.

1:20:47

Just a scared little American. Living in California.

1:20:53

Interviewer: Just one more question. Interviewer: Just one more question. Do you think there is a chance that

1:21:00

we might get rid of this love for attractiveness?

1:21:09

It's this visual thing. And you said rebellion is supposed to be attractive.

1:21:16

People think, well, it's attractive to take your gun and be this rebel.

1:21:21

But the true rebellion is not supposed to be attractive, because it just isn't.

1:21:27

So how do we get rid of all this visual ...

1:21:33

It's weird to be saying this on television. It's weird to be saying this on television. There's something about ... there's nothing wrong ...

1:21:42

It's not that there's anything wrong with being interested in stuff that's interesting and attractive. What it seems to be like here is ...

1:21:52

Television and corporate entertainment, because it's so expensive, in order to make money,

1:22:00

it has to appeal to a very wide audience. Which means it has to find things that a lot of people have in common.

1:22:06

And I don't know about you, but here, I think, what most of us have in common here

1:22:13

are our very most base, uninteresting, selfish, stupid interests.

1:22:19

Physical attractiveness. Sex. A certain kind of easy humor. Vivid spectacle.

1:22:26

That's stuff that I will immediately look at, and so will you, and so will you.

1:22:33

So it's in our very most base and childish interests that we are a mass.

1:22:40

The things that make us interesting and unique and human, those interests tend to be wildly different between different people.

1:22:49

So, my guess is ... In terms of American mass culture, as a mass,

1:22:57

for things to get significantly different, what it's going to involve is fragmentation in the entertainment industry.

1:23:06

Something like what's happened in the American magazine industry, where instead of three or four magazines with millions of subscribers,

1:23:15

you have thousands of magazines, each with a few thousand. That is, if entertainment can get more niche -

1:23:22

N, I, C, H, E, is the English word - it's possible that these companies that put this stuff out

1:23:31

can stay alive and make money without having to appeal to ten, twenty million people.

1:23:36

Because I don't think that it's evil. It's just the way that it works. The only way to get ten or twenty million people all interested in the same thing

1:23:45

is to pitch your appeal very very low. Because maybe you're not interested in any of the things that I named,

1:23:52

you know, just immediately, but I am. I'm no different than anybody else. I'm not, really.
