## Use case
The Fourier Transform is used to transform a function of time to a function of frequency. With this, it is possible to tell what frequency is present in a particular sound and how strong each frequency is. 
## Mathematical Definition

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} \, dt
$$

- $F(\omega)$ is the Fourier Transform of $f(t)$.
- $t$ represents time.
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency (in radians per second).
- $e^{-i \omega t}$ is the complex exponential function.
