The Output nodes are assigned such that each node represents one particular class in the classification problem.  
## Softmax (Normalized Exponential)

$$
y_i=\frac{e^{v_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^N e^{v_j}} \in[0,1]
$$

Where, 
- $y_i\rightarrow$ 
- $v_i\rightarrow$ It is the output from the Hidden Layer before applying the activation function.
