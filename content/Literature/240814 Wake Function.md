The generalized velocity derivative in [[240613 Law of the Wall and Wall Units|Plus units]].

$$
\frac{\partial u^{+}}{\partial y^{+}}=\frac{1}{y^{+}} \Phi\left(\frac{y}{\delta_v}\right)
$$

Here the $\Phi$ represents the universal [[240814 Wake Function|Wake function]] which accounts for the wakes in the flow i.e turbulent behaviour. Depending on which layer of the [[240612 Nature of Wall Bounded Turbulent Flow|wall bounded flow]] it is in, different Wake functions can be used.
