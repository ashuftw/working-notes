- Stress acting on a element has 9 components of Stress. This is because by definition, the stress is the response to the force acting per unit area. 
- This means that the stress is dependant on the direction of the force, but also the orientation of the area (which has two components) with respect to the force. 
- Hence we have three Normal stress components and 6 Shear stress components which can be represented by the Stress Tensor. $$\left[{\begin{matrix}
T^{(\mathbf n)}_1 & T^{(\mathbf n)}_2 & T^{(\mathbf n)}_3\end{matrix}}\right]=\left[{\begin{matrix}
n_1 & n_2 & n_3
\end{matrix}}\right]\cdot
\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{11} & \sigma _{12} & \sigma _{13} \\
\sigma _{21} & \sigma _{22} & \sigma _{23} \\
\sigma _{31} & \sigma _{32} & \sigma _{33} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]$$
