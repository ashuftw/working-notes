## Ways to record research progress
- My supervisor has reviews every quarter or so
- In the lab: excel sheet
- Reports after each experiment
- funding 
- not always expected result failure is also useful. Don't have reinvent the wheel. 

## Data Documentation
- Document the exchange between supervisor and you. Make the exchange known to both sides.
	- Resolves misunderstandings.
	- Proof of communication. 
	- Everything that hasn't been documented - hasn't taken place. 
- Document the work that you are doing - helps prove ownership and credibility. 
- Ask the supervisor for written rules for document keeping. 

## Plagiarism
- Don't use any online plagiarism tools. Using a 3rd part tool may index your manuscript online and make it fail a test in the official tool used by the university. 
- Never upload your manuscript online. 
**Sloppy Work:** Spelling mistake or a grammatical mistake
**Questionable Practice:** Using a GPT to fix the errror or grammatical error.
**Severe Misconduct:** Hiring someone to rewrite the thesis for you.
