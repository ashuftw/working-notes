It is a mathematical model used to describe fluids assuming that they are inviscid, incompressibe and irrotational. 
It defines a potential function, $\phi(t,x,y,z)$ as a continuous function satisfying conversation laws such that.

$$
\vec V=\nabla \phi
$$

Components
$$
u=\frac{\partial \phi}{d x}, v=\frac{\partial \phi}{d y} \text { and } w=\frac{\partial \phi}{d z}
$$
