## Mathematical Definition
![[Pasted image 20240206145007.png]]
- RHS of the Exact differential equation is zero. This means that the [[240207 Potential Function|potential function]] does not change for small step $dx$ and $dy$. 
- $A(x, y)=\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$ and $B(x, y)=\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$.

## Example
Potential function, $F(x, y)=\frac{1}{2} x^2+\frac{1}{2} y^2$.

The *Exact Differential Equation* would be the gradient of the function obeying the condition stated above. 
$$
A(x, y) d x+B(x, y) d y=0
$$
where $A(x, y)=\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}=x$ and $B(x, y)=\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}=y$.
The *Exact Differential Equation*  
$$
x d x+y d y=0
$$

> **Note:** The condition $\frac{\partial A}{\partial y} =\frac{\partial B}{\partial x}$, holds.          


The path on the solution field of the [[240207 Potential Function|Potential Function]] where the value is constant (Constant elevation) is given as  follows.

> **Note:** The example chosen was  Potential function whose Gradient was known to be an Exact differential equation. 
> In the course, you are asked to build a potential function or verify if a differential equation is exact.
