- Check if given Functions are solutions (In case it isn't clear. )
- [[230212 Conditions for a Differential Equation to be Linear|Check if Differential Equation is Linear]]
- [[230212 Linearly Independent Solutions|Check if the Solutions are Linearly Independent]]
- The General Solution can be written as 
$$
\boxed{y=y_1C_1+y_2C_2+...y_nC_n}
$$
