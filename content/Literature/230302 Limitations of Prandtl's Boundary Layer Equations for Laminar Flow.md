  
- The Approximation of the Boundary layer is applicable for laminar flows with large Reynolds number. 
- As the Reynolds number decreases, the accuracy decreases.
- Assumption that $\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}$  is not valid for flow on a curved surface where the curvature is close to the value of $\delta$
- In case of Back-flow, the equations aren't valid at the region of separation.
