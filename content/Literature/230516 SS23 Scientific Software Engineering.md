## Design Patterns
Are solution templates for a wide range of recurring problems in software engineering. They can be classified into 3 types:
1. **Creational Patterns**: They abstract the instantiation process. Thus a system that uses this pattern doesn't need to know how it's objects are created. 
	- [[230807 Abstract Factory Pattern|Abstract Factory Pattern]]
	- [[230807 Builder Pattern|Builder Pattern]]
	- [[230810 Singleton Pattern|Singleton Pattern]]
2. **Behavioural Patterns**: Are concerned with algorithms and assignment of responsibilities between objects. This is done by establishing efficient communication between them. 
	- [[230807 Observer Design Pattern|Observer Pattern]]
	- [[230816 Command Pattern|Command Pattern]]
	- [[230816 Strategy Pattern|Strategy Pattern]]
3. **Structural Patterns**: They are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

## Test Driven Development
naming convention for tests: given_name_then 
Note: You cannot have an instance of an interface 
purpose of having a separate setup function: each test gets in own object. Which is a thing cause you don't have to worry about the object having an altered inititial state
