Also called [[230608 Contraction|Contraction]]-mapping theorem. 

The theorem states that when a contraction is applied to a [[230608 Metric Space|Metric Space]], there is at least one point that is fixed i.e., contracts on to itself. 

### Mathematically 
Let $(X, d)$ be a complete metric space and let $T: X \rightarrow X$ be a contraction on $X$. Then $T$ has a unique fixed point $x \in X($ such that $T(x)=x)$.
