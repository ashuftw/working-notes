  

- A Newtonian fluid is one whose viscosity is independent of the ratio of the shear stress and the shear rate. 
- Thus, the Flow curve/ Rheogram of a Newtonian fluid is a straight line that passes through the origin. 
- Additionally, the [[Deviatoric Stress| Deviatoric Stresses]]  in a Newtonian flow are zero.
