### 1. Discretization of  the PDE 
- **Analytical Problem** 
$$
\Delta u=f
$$

	Note: $f$ is the source term. 
- **Discrete Problem** 
$$
\mathbf{A u}=\mathbf{f}
$$

	Note: $\mathbf A$ is the finite dimensional representation of $\Delta$ and includes the boundary condition. 
### 2. Find Approximate solution
- A problem suited algorithm needs to be chosen to compute.


$$
\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{f}
$$

### 3. Evaluate the solution $u$
- $\mathbf u$ is plotted.
