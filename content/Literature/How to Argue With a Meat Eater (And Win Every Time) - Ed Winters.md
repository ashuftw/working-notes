## Understanding people's arguments 
- People default to [[240904 Motivated reasoning|Motivated reasoning]] and confirmation bias. They accept the status quo and build their reasoning around it. 
	- Causes: misinformation
	- Solution: 
		- Ask people to explain their reasoning. 
		- If people refer a particular post or article, ask them to send it to you later, if they aren't able to recall it. 
		- Offer your sources too. 
- Being vegan is a personal choice and since it is tied so closely with morality. Making the wrong choice puts in question the morality of a person. This can be seen as a personal attack.
