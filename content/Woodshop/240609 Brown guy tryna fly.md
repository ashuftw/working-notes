I started playing basketball when I was 13. And the decision was pretty straightforward, I just wanted to be on "a" school team. At the time I was really into soccer and I'd like to think that I was even pretty decent at it but there was no way I could make it to the team or even get to play during lunch breaks.
Soccer was really popular and the older kids just wouldn't let us play with them and to be fair we didn't have enough space for it. 

So I played volleyball for a bit and then switched to basketball and I've more or less stuck with it.  I was a pretty small kid, I think I was literally the second shortest kid in my class and at the time most girls were taller than me. Add to that, I even wanted to be play "post", as a big man. Hilarious stuff. My first pair of basketball shoes were UK 9. For context, I wear a UK 7 these days. Maybe it's a very Asian thing? My parents bought me clothes that would be insanely huge and I guess the point was to have your clothes wear out before you grow out of them.

I'm 25 now and a few months ago I was 24. I don't feel any different although I definitely am. Each moment there are probably thousands of cells in my body that are dying and getting replaced by new cells. By the time I completely check out, I've probably died multiple deaths. Apparently quite a lot of people have spent time thinking about this very thing about personal identity and I really like this Greek mythology used as a thought experiment called "The Ship of Theseus". The specifics of the story are irrelevant but essentially, a  king called Theseus slays a monster and gets the hell out of there by getting on a ship on it's way to an island called to Delos. The people of Athens are super happy about this and to celebrate Theseus and his victory, they start a tradition of traveling to Delos every year as a pilgrimage.   

My intuition is that I will feel consistent with the me that is thinking about these things right now. However in both cases I have reasons to believe that that intuition is shaky. Paraphrasing John Green, "You remember the memory of what happened and then what you remember becomes what happened". I'm sure everyone comes across life experiences like that. The earliest one I can think about was when I thought my family visited the moon by strapping ourselves to a rocket. I was talking about this very matter-of-fact with my mother and I just didn't get why she didn't believe me. Much later I think when I was in grade school or so, I realized that the whole thing was a dream and at the time I probably just didn't know what dreams were.  Even that memory is pretty faulty 'cause I remember the visuals of that. Which are strikingly similar to Volume 16 of the Comic series Adventures of Tintin called Destination Moon which I would in no way come across until 7th grade.

i googled it and apparently the cells in your heart and neurons don't change that much
maybe it's a bit like contraction mapping. There seems to be one value that is at the core and that part doesn't really change that much. I mean naval says that you're a blank slate when you're born but again that opens up the nurture vs nature can of worms. Anecdotally twins born in the same household can grown to become different persons. But I also think that it just could be a nature thing or even just external stimuli that grows compounds in net effectiveness like a page out of a chaos theory text book.
