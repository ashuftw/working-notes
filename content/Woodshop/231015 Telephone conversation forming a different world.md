I remember being having my first phone. I think I was 12 and had a dumb phone. It was so exciting to talk to friends. It wasn't something I experienced before. It was my first contact in the world of texting and non face to face communication. I guess I must have not thought about it before, at least on a meta-level. It seemed for the brief moment a different kind of world existed beyond the physical space
