I'm Ashu and these are my working notes. The organization of these notes is inspired by [[Niklas Luhmann's Slipbox]] and [[Andy Matuschak's Tools for Thought]] culminating in my own pithy approach with [[Purpose Driven Writing]]. 

> If writing is the medium of research and studying is nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing.
