In my opinion, taking *Permanent Notes* is the keystone idea of the Zettelkasten method.

**ONE NOTE = ONE IDEA**
Permanent ideas are supposed to be atomic. In that, they must be fairly independent  and generally re-usable in different contexts. The atomicity of an idea is what makes or breaks the usability of Zettels once you reach critical mass. 

**The trap**
Block out a few minutes to really introspect how a new note fits into your current repository of ideas. Don't just collect ideas, collect contradictions, questions and make connections. Run a tight ship, keep your Slip-box from [[220422 Run a tight Ship|diluting in value]]. 

**Tags**
Don't worry about broad-strokes Taxonomy. Link each note to a tag that best represents the topic. Suppose you're learning about Upwind Differencing, which probably isn't atomic in it's definition. You maybe wanna link it to something like *Differencing* instead of say *CFD* which is much more general. What this allows you to do, is to make a [[Map of Contents]] when a topic like differencing reaches [[220318 Critical Mass|Critical Mass]].
