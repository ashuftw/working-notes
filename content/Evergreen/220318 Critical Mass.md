When sufficient notes cluster around a single note,  you achieve Critical mass. At this point you've witnessed an emergent structure amongst your notes. 

Rather than imposing a top down hierarchical index, a structure emerges depending on how often a particular Idea is used in several other contexts. At this point, you can make a 
[[Map of Contents|Map of Content]] to help navigate throught afore mentioned cluster of notes.
