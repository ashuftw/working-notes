 [[220210 Taking literature notes|Literature notes]] are written in the perspective of the reference material and [[220210 How to take Permanent Notes?|Permanent notes]] are written in the perspective of your Knowledge infrastructure. 

However, in both cases you write the ideas in your own words and fill in nuances that are specific to your understanding. You can't write everything down and you don't want to either. Draw the essence from the text and summarise it in your own words. This forces you to develop a deep understanding of the material you're dealing with. 

This deep understanding enables you to extend upon what you've written and ask deeper question. What is research other than answering or at least trying to ask question? 
If done properly, studying *is* research,.

> If writing is the medium of research and studying is nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing.
