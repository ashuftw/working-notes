Absenteeism is a chronic problem in schools in Kenya, and deworming reduced it by 25 percent. In fact, every child treated spent an extra two weeks in school, and every one hundred dollars spent on the program provided a total of ten years of additional school attendance among all students. — location: [224]() ^ref-62315

But relying on good intentions alone to inform your decisions is potentially disastrous. — location: [244]() ^ref-42196

If you earn more than $52,000 per year, then, speaking globally, you are the 1 percent. If you earn at least $28,000—that’s the typical income for working individuals in the United States—you’re in the richest 5 percent of the world’s population. Even someone living below the US poverty line, earning just $11,000 per year, is still richer than 85 percent of people in the world. — location: [341]() ^ref-7200

the conclusions from the economic studies suggest is that the benefit you get from having your salary doubled is the same as the benefit an extremely poor Indian farmer gets from having his salary doubled. If you’re on the typical US wage of $28,000 per year, the benefit you’d get from an additional $28,000 in income is the same as the benefit a poor Indian farmer would get from an additional $220. — location: [394]() ^ref-45077

Sometimes we look at the size of the problems in the world and think, “Anything I do would be just a drop in the bucket. So why bother?” But, in light of the research shown in these graphs, that reasoning doesn’t make any sense. It’s the size of the drop that — location: [426]() ^ref-55241

1s, 2s, and 3s, how many more lives would have been lost? If he had made no choice—if he had put his hands in the air and claimed defeat, or if he had simply tried to treat whoever came in first—he would have made the worst choice of all. — location: [459]() ^ref-16516

We can overcome this problem by thinking in terms of improving lives rather than in terms of intermediate metrics like number of schoolbooks provided. — location: [500]() ^ref-19561

we need to measure impact in terms of the size of the benefits we confer through those actions. — location: [502]() ^ref-42210

which, like the graph in chapter one, represents global income distribution. This graph shows how many people live in various income brackets. Notice how different this is from the distribution of height. In this graph, the right-hand “tail” of the curve just keeps going. In fact, in order to make the shape of the curve visible on the page, I had to cut off the graph at $6,000 per year, even though 20 percent of the world earns more than that. Distributions that look like this are called fat-tailed distributions. — location: [700]() ^ref-11522
