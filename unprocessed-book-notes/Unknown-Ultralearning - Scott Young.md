## Highlights
“In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is.”* — location: [65]() ^ref-29553

Lewis explained his approach: Start speaking the very first day. Don’t be afraid to talk to strangers. Use a phrasebook to get started; save formal study for later. Use visual mnemonics to memorize vocabulary. What struck me were not the methods but the boldness with which he applied them. — location: [184]() ^ref-50082

---
Barone’s strategy was simple but effective. He practiced by working directly on the graphics he wanted to use in his game. — location: [275]() ^ref-20111

---
Your deepest moments of happiness don’t come from doing easy things; they come from realizing your potential and overcoming your own limiting beliefs about yourself. — location: [431]() ^ref-23853

---
Technology exaggerates both the vices and the virtues of humanity. Our vices are made worse because now they are downloadable, portable, and socially transmissible. — location: [475]() ^ref-12884

---
stories usually involve heroic schedules. Though this makes for good storytelling, it’s actually unnecessary when it comes to pursuing your own ultralearning projects. The core of the ultralearning strategy is intensity and a willingness to prioritize effectiveness. — location: [563]() ^ref-26462

Once, when faced with the choice between polishing an existing speech and creating a brand-new one from scratch, de Montebello asked what he should do. Gendler’s response was to do whichever was scariest for him. — location: [626]() ^ref-52786

if you have several hours to study, you’re possibly better off covering a few topics rather than focusing exclusively on one. — location: [1080]() ^ref-42107

We want to speak a language but try to learn mostly by playing on fun apps, rather than conversing with actual people. We want to work on collaborative, professional programs but mostly code scripts in isolation. We want to become great speakers, so we buy a book on communication, rather than practice presenting. In all these cases the problem is the same: directly learning the thing we want feels too uncomfortable, boring, or frustrating, so we settle for some book, lecture, or app, hoping it will eventually make us better at the real thing. Directness is the hallmark of most ultralearning projects.* Roger Craig did his Jeopardy! testing on the actual questions from past shows. Eric Barone learned video game art by making art for his video game. Benny Lewis learns to speak languages quickly by following a policy of attempting some back-and-forth dialog from the very first day. What these approaches share is that the learning activities are always done with a connection to the context in which the skills learned will eventually be used. — location: [1216]() ^ref-22586

---
During the MIT Challenge, I recognized that the most important resource for being able to eventually pass the classes wasn’t having access to recorded lectures, it was having access to problem sets. — location: [1237]() ^ref-10811

---
The easiest way to learn directly is to simply spend a lot of time doing the thing you want to become good at. — location: [1244]() ^ref-5860

---
If you want to learn a language, speak it, as Benny Lewis does. If you want to master making video games, then make them, as Eric Barone does. If you want to pass a test, practice solving the kinds of problems that are likely to appear on it, as I did in my own MIT Challenge. — location: [1245]() ^ref-14077

Transfer — location: [1261]() ^ref-29544

---
It happens when you learn something in one context, say in a classroom, and are able to use it in another context, say in real life. — location: [1261]() ^ref-21619

---
Michelene Chi noted that “in almost all the empirical work to date, on the role of example solutions, a student who has studied examples often cannot solve problems that deviate slightly from the example solution.”4 — location: [1275]() ^ref-10271

---
Thorndike was able to refute this idea by showing that the ability to transfer was much narrower than most people had assumed. — location: [1289]() ^ref-14040

Edward Thorndike and Robert Woodworth in 1901, with their seminal paper “The Influence of Improvement in One Mental Function upon the Efficiency of Other Functions.” In it, they attacked the dominant theory of education at the time, so-called formal discipline theory. This theory suggested that the brain was analogous to a muscle, containing fairly general capacities of memory, attention, and reasoning, and that training those muscles, irrespective of the content, could result in general improvement. — location: [1285]() ^ref-36442

---
educational pundits are reviving new incarnations of the formal discipline theory by suggesting that everyone learn programming or critical thinking in order to improve their general intelligence. — location: [1291]() ^ref-56526

Overcoming the Problem of Transfer with Directness — location: [1304]() ^ref-50024

---
Although the findings of the research on transfer are fairly bleak, there is a glimmer of hope, which is that gaining a deeper knowledge of a subject will make it more flexible for future transfer. Whereas the structures of our knowledge start out brittle, welded to the environments and contexts we learn them in, with more work and time they can become flexible and can be applied more broadly. This is the conclusion of Robert Haskell, — location: [1346]() ^ref-42898

---
It is often more frustrating, challenging, and intense than reading a book or sitting through a lecture. But this very difficulty creates a potent source of competitive advantage for any would-be ultralearner. — location: [1356]() ^ref-744

take advantage of the inadequacies of more typical schooling. — location: [1359]() ^ref-52698

---
if you organize your learning around producing something, you’re guaranteed to at least learn how to produce that thing. — location: [1361]() ^ref-15028

---
when direct practice is impossible, a simulation of the environment will work to the degree to which it remains faithful to the cognitive elements of the task in question. — location: [1381]() ^ref-33430

---
The overkill approach is to put yourself into an environment where the demands are going to be extremely high, so you’re unlikely to miss any important lessons or feedback. — location: [1394]() ^ref-54238

---
The first week in each new country in my language learning project was always a shock, but soon it became completely normal to live entirely within the new language. — location: [1399]() ^ref-48122

---
Deciding in advance that your work will be viewable publicly alters your approach to learning and will gear you toward performance in the desired domain, rather than just checking off boxes of facts learned. — location: [1404]() ^ref-3520

---
Another friend of mine decided to exhibit her photography as a means of pushing her skills and talent. Deciding in advance that your work will be viewable publicly alters your approach to learning and will gear you toward performance in the desired domain, rather than just checking off boxes of facts learned. — location: [1403]() ^ref-58473

---
Whenever you learn anything new, it’s a good habit to ask yourself where and how the knowledge will manifest itself. If you can answer that, you can then ask whether you’re doing anything to tie what you’re learning to that context. If you’re not, you need to tread carefully, as the problem of transfer may rear its ugly head. — location: [1407]() ^ref-39710

Take care of the bars and the piece will take care of itself. —Philip Johnston, composer — location: [1415]() ^ref-31870

the strategy behind doing drills. By identifying a rate-determining step in your learning reaction, you can isolate it and work on it specifically. Since it governs the overall competence you have with that skill, by improving at it you will improve faster than if you try to practice every aspect of the skill at once. — location: [1468]() ^ref-5820

---
chemistry, there’s a useful concept known as the rate-determining step. This occurs when a reaction takes place over multiple steps, with the products of one reaction becoming the reagents for another. The rate-determining step is the slowest part of this chain of reactions, forming a bottleneck that ultimately defines the amount of time needed for the entire reaction to occur. — location: [1457]() ^ref-12212

---
A drill takes the direct practice and cuts it apart, so that you are practicing only an isolated component. How can you resolve this contradiction? — location: [1486]() ^ref-27224

---
The final step is to go back to direct practice and integrate what you’ve learned. — location: [1497]() ^ref-923

After determining the weakest link, you isolate it and drill. Then

---
Many attempts to isolate a drill may end in failure because the drill doesn’t really cut at the heart of what was difficult in real practice. That’s okay; this feedback is important to help you minimize wasting time learning things that don’t matter much to your end goals. — location: [1500]() ^ref-23411

---
As you approach mastery, your time may end up focused mostly on drills as your knowledge of how the complex skill breaks down into individual components becomes more refined and accurate and improving any individual component gets harder and harder. — location: [1505]() ^ref-53816

Drill 1: Time Slicing — location: [1523]() ^ref-11393

---
When speaking a language, grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary occur at all moments, but they form different cognitive aspects that must be managed simultaneously. The tactic here is to find a way to drill only one component when, in practice, others would be applied at the same time. — location: [1530]() ^ref-56938

---
starting too hard and learning prerequisites as they are needed can be frustrating, but it saves a lot of time learning subskills that don’t actually drive performance much. — location: [1552]() ^ref-60177

I think you can somehow achieve being "Direct" in learning this way.

It pays better to wait and recollect by an effort from within, than to look at the book again. —William James, psychologist — location: [1577]() ^ref-6036

---
Without the answers at hand, Ramanujan was forced to invent his own solutions to the problems, retrieving information from his mind rather than reviewing it in a book. — location: [1631]() ^ref-1588

---
One resource he did encounter and mined extensively was a volume by George Shoobridge Carr called A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics. — location: [1597]() ^ref-18188

---
The book, intended as a guide for students, included large lists of various theorems from different fields of mathematics, usually without explanation or proof. However, even without having proofs or explanations available, — location: [1599]() ^ref-16067

On questions based directly on the content of the text, those who practiced free recall remembered almost 50 percent more than the other groups. — location: [1617]() ^ref-39198

Free recall — location: [1653]() ^ref-7225

Free recall is better than cued recall and both of them are better than recognition test -mcq

---
The idea, therefore, is to find the right midpoint: far enough away to make whatever is retrieved remembered deeply, not so far away that you’ve forgotten everything. — location: [1666]() ^ref-19933

---
Some researchers argue that it may be that trying to find knowledge that hasn’t been learned yet—say, by trying to solve a problem you haven’t learned the answer to yet—nonetheless helps reinforce search strategies that are put to use once the knowledge is encountered later. — location: [1677]() ^ref-15117

Linkto ramanujan's genius

There will always be some things you choose to master and others you satisfy yourself with knowing you can look up if you need to. One way to answer this question is simply to do direct practice. — location: [1693]() ^ref-57908

What’s harder and more useful is to restate the big idea of a chapter or section as a question. Since this is often implicit, it requires some deeper thinking and not just adding a question mark to some notes you copied verbatim. — location: [1740]() ^ref-24187

---
By preventing yourself from consulting the source, the information becomes knowledge stored inside your head instead of inside a reference manual. — location: [1754]() ^ref-27437

obsessive intensity and retrieval practice. — location: [1757]() ^ref-37060

---
In his studies, Ericsson has found that the ability to gain immediate feedback on one’s performance is an essential ingredient in reaching expert levels of performance. No feedback, and the result is often stagnation—long periods of time when you continue to use a skill but don’t get any better at it. Sometimes the lack of feedback can even result in declining abilities. — location: [1799]() ^ref-8486
