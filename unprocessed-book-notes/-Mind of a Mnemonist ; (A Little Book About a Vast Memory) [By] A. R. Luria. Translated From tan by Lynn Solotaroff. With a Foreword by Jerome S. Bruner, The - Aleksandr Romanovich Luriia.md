It is difficult to say whether elements in this description go back to actual experiences S. had in — location: []() ^ref-36978

I'm sitting in a restaurant—there's music. You know why they have music in restaurants? Because it — location: []() ^ref-6390

changes the taste of everything. If you select the right kind of music, everything tastes good. Surely people who work in restaurants know this . . . — location: []() ^ref-29514

So one time I went to buy some ice cream, thinking I'd sit there and eat it and not have this clanging. I walked over to the vender and asked her what kind of ice cream she had. "Fruit ice cream," she said. But she answered in such a tone that a whole pile of coals, of black cinders, came bursting out of her mouth, and I couldn't bring myself to buy any ice cream after she'd answered that way . . . Another thing: If I read when I eat, I have a hard time understanding what I'm reading—the taste of the food drowns out the sense . . . — location: []() ^ref-17146

It's been worked out on the basis of years of experience. I can see how it has developed, and what it means to me is that one has to rely on his own sensations of things. If nothing can appear to a person, that means it is something. That's where the trouble comes in . . . — location: []() ^ref-51549

What pointless images come up on account of a single word. Take the word something, for example. For me this is a dense cloud of steam that has the color of smoke. When I hear the word nothing, I also see a cloud, but one that is thinner, completely transparent. And when I try to seize a particle of this nothing, I get the most minute particles of nothing. — location: []() ^ref-468

On the whole, however, S. did learn to master most of what he had to in life: he associated with people, attended courses, took examinations. However, each attempt to move beyond the unsteady plateaus of his level of understanding to some higher awareness proved arduous, for at each step he had to contend with superfluous images and sensations. — location: []() ^ref-21500

Could he also use this as a means of overcoming pain? S. had told us about the methods he used to avoid experiencing severe pain: Let's say I'm going to the dentist. You know how pleasant it is to sit there and let him drill your teeth. I used to be afraid to go. But now it's all so simple. I sit there and when the pain starts I feel it . . . it's a tiny, orange-red thread . . . I'm upset because I know that if this keeps up, the thread will widen until it turns into a dense mass . . . So I cut the thread, make it smaller and smaller, until it's just a tiny point. And the pain disappears. Later I tried a different method. I'd sit in the chair but imagine it wasn't really me but someone else. I, S., would merely stand by and observe "him" getting his teeth drilled. Let him feel the pain . . . It doesn't hurt me, you understand, but "him." I just don't feel any pain. — location: []() ^ref-25866

With each individual there is a dividing line between imagination and reality; for most of us whose imaginations have distinct limits, this is fairly clearcut. In S.'s case the borderline between the two had broken down, for the images his imagination conjured up took on the feel of reality. This is the way things tended to work when I was a boy and going to Hebrew school. I'd wake up and see that it was morning and that I had to get up . . . I'd look at the clock and think: "No, there's still time, I can stay in bed for a while." And I'd continue to see the hands of the clock pointing at 7:30, which meant it was still early. Suddenly my mother would come in and say: "What, you haven't left yet? Why, it'll soon be nine." Well, how was I to know that? I saw the big hand pointing down—according to the clock, it was 7:30. — location: []() ^ref-13463

Can a person who "sees" everything; who cannot understand a thing unless an impression of it "leaks" through all his sense organs; who must feel a telephone number on the tip of his tongue before he can remember it —can he possibly develop as others do? — location: []() ^ref-42351

It's morning . . . I have to go to school. Soon it'll be eight o'clock. I have to get up, get dressed, put on my coat and hat, my galoshes . . . I can't stay in bed. I start to get angry, for I see I have to go to school . . . But why shouldn't "he" go? No, I won't go. He'll get up and get dressed. There he is, he's getting his coat and cap, putting on his galoshes. Now he's gone. So everything's as it should be. I stay home, and "he" goes off. But suddenly my father walks in and says: "It's so late, and you haven't left for school yet? — location: []() ^ref-38123

This was a habit I had for quite some time; perhaps even now I still do it. I'd look at a clock and for a long while continue to see the hands fixed just as they were, and not realize time had passed . . . That's why I'm often late. — location: []() ^ref-14479

This kind of split between the "I" who issues orders and the "he" who carries them out (whom the "I" in S. visualized) persisted throughout his life. "He" would go off when it was necessary; "he" would recall things; the "I" would merely instruct, direct, control. If we had not been aware of the psychological mechanisms behind those vivid graphic "visions" of S.'s which we have examined in such detail here, we might easily have been led to take him for one of those "split personalities" psychiatrists deal with, and with whom S.'s particular kind of "cutting himself off" had so little in common. — location: []() ^ref-40547

However, his unstable grasp of reality, and the realistic overtones of his fantasies, had a far more profound effect on his personality development. For he lived in wait of something that he assumed was to come his way, and gave himself up to dreaming and "seeing" far more than to functioning in life. The sense he had that something particularly fine was about to happen remained with him throughout his life—something which would solve all his problems and make his life simple and clear. He "saw" this and waited . . . Thus, everything he did in life was merely "temporary," what he had to do until the expected would finally come to pass. — location: []() ^ref-43328
