## Highlights
At this lowest point in her life, the Buddha appeared to her in a dream. A luminous presence, he softly chanted a verse from the Dhammapada, originally offered as consolation to a father grieving the death of his son: Clinging to what is dear brings sorrow, Clinging to what is dear brings fear. To one who is entirely free from endearment, There is no sorrow or fear. — location: [231]() ^ref-43841

Presenting tough but effective lessons for people who wanted to meditate in the midst of busy lives as householders, Dipa Ma taught her students to use every moment as an opportunity for practice. Mindfulness, she said, could be applied to every activity: speaking, ironing, cooking, shopping, caring for children. “The whole path of mindfulness,” she repeated tirelessly, “is this: ‘Whatever you are doing, be aware of it.’” Dipa Ma had so much faith in the power of practice amid the hubbub of home life that one admirer dubbed her “The Patron Saint of Householders.” — location: [349]() ^ref-3168

“If you are a householder, you have enough time,” Dipa Ma told me. “Very early in the morning, you can take two hours for meditation. Late in the evening you can take another two hours for meditation. Learn to sleep only four hours. There is no need for sleeping more than four hours.” — location: [482]() ^ref-58602

LESSON TWO Meditate every day “Practice now. Don’t think you will do more later.” Dipa Ma stated firmly that if you want peace, you must practice regularly. She insisted that students find time for formal meditation practice every day, even if only for five minutes. If that proved impossible, she advised, “At least when you are in bed at night, notice just one in-breath and one out-breath before you fall asleep.” — location: [1226]() ^ref-60456

“If you are busy, then busyness is the meditation,” she told him. “When you do calculations, know that you are doing calculations. Meditation is to know what you are doing. If you are rushing to the office, then you should be mindful of ‘rushing.’ — location: [1234]() ^ref-1028

“There is so much sameness in ordinary life. We are always experiencing everything through the same set of lenses. Once greed, hatred, and delusion are gone, you see everything fresh and new all the time. Every moment is new. Life was dull before. Now, every day, every moment is full of taste and zest.” — location: [1296]() ^ref-16475

In every way, Dipa Ma lived in the greatest simplicity. She refrained from socializing. She did not engage in unnecessary talk.
