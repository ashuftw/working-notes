A job, in Wrzesniewski’s formulation, is a way to pay the bills, a career is a path toward increasingly better work, and a calling is work that’s an important part of your life and a vital part of your identity. — location: [345]() ^ref-31697

---
In Wrzesniewski’s research, the happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do. — location: [362]() ^ref-21761

dedication to constantly stretching your abilities. — location: [1029]() ^ref-32231

---
The “serious study” employed by top chess players sounds similar to Jordan Tice’s approach to music: They’re both focused on difficult activities, carefully chosen to stretch your abilities where they most need stretching and that provide immediate feedback. — location: [1092]() ^ref-50636

---
It is a lifetime accumulation of deliberate practice that again and again ends up explaining excellence. — location: [1112]() ^ref-52877

Step 1: Decide What Capital Market You’re In — location: [1195]() ^ref-19090

---
There are two types of these markets: winner-take-all and auction. — location: [1198]() ^ref-13653

---
Television writing is a winner-take-all market because all that matters is your ability to write good scripts. — location: [1199]() ^ref-19267

---
The cleantech space is an auction market. Mike Jackson’s capital, for example, included expertise in renewable energy markets and entrepreneurship, but there are a variety of other types of relevant skills that also could have led to a job in this field. — location: [1202]() ^ref-53517

---
Step 2: Identify Your Capital Type — location: [1229]() ^ref-29087

---
A useful heuristic in this situation is to seek open gates—opportunities to build capital that are already open to you. — location: [1231]() ^ref-26950

---
Step 3: Define “Good” — location: [1242]() ^ref-28068

---
deliberate practice, — location: [1246]() ^ref-60847

---
Step 4: Stretch and Destroy — location: [1253]() ^ref-51181

---
If you’re not uncomfortable, then you’re probably stuck at an “acceptable level.” — location: [1267]() ^ref-18110

---
Pushing past what’s comfortable, however, is only one part of the deliberate-practice story; the other part is embracing honest feedback—even if it destroys what you thought was good. — location: [1268]() ^ref-49006

---
Step 5: Be Patient — location: [1278]() ^ref-35405

---
“diligence” — location: [1284]() ^ref-55464

---
less about paying attention to your main pursuit, and more about your willingness to ignore other pursuits that pop up along the way to distract you. — location: [1285]() ^ref-11026

---
Without this patient willingness to reject shiny new pursuits, you’ll derail your efforts before you acquire the capital you need. — location: [1289]() ^ref-16379

---
It captures well the feel of how career capital is actually acquired: You stretch yourself, day after day, month after month, before finally looking up and realizing, “Hey, I’ve become pretty good, and people are starting to notice.” — location: [1291]() ^ref-10539

---
more control, — location: [1607]() ^ref-59909

Use career capital to get more control not necessarily better pay  and prestige

“Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you’re aiming to be valuable.” — location: [1673]() ^ref-44366

---
“Do what people are willing to pay for.” — location: [1671]() ^ref-2506

---
The Law of Financial Viability When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on. — location: [1688]() ^ref-52697

---
Hardness scares off the daydreamers and the timid, leaving more opportunity for those like us who are willing to take the time to carefully work out the best path forward and then confidently take action. — location: [1826]() ^ref-54449

As I mentioned, understanding the adjacent possible and its role in innovation is the first link in a chain of argument that explains how to identify a good career mission. — location: [1892]() ^ref-13666

---
Scientific breakthroughs, as we just learned, require that you first get to the cutting edge of your field. Only then can you see the adjacent possible beyond, the space where innovative ideas are almost always discovered. — location: [1895]() ^ref-41243

---
A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough—it’s an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field. If you want to identify a mission for your working life, therefore, you must first get to the cutting edge—the only place where these missions become visible. — location: [1898]() ^ref-35772
