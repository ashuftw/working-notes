“The Barnum effect refers to the tendency for people to accept as uncannily descriptive of themselves the same generally worded assessment as long as they believe it was written specifically for them on the basis of some ‘diagnostic’ instrument such as a horoscope or personality inventory.” — location: [223]() ^ref-8933

Pfungst finally understood. Hans wasn’t a genius. What Hans could do was read people extremely well. Research shows that horses are able to detect head movements in humans as small as one-fifth of a millimeter. Sufficiently motivated by a tasty lump of sugar, Hans was picking up on unconscious cues that questioners would make when he performed the correct number of stomps. Hans was just a regular horse, motivated by food, responding to stimuli. — location: [291]() ^ref-50290

Truth be told, if you wanted to focus on something, skip body language and laser focus on their speech. When we can hear someone but not see them, empathic ability declines only about 4 percent. When we can see someone but not hear them, the drop-off is a whopping 54 percent. Pay less attention to whether they cross their legs and more attention to when their voice changes. — location: [376]() ^ref-17463

The maxim might be “don’t judge a book by its cover,” and, right or wrong, there’s a good reason such advice is given: because we do judge a book by its cover. — location: [441]() ^ref-10704

So the first step to being better at reading people is to be curious. Even better is to provide yourself with some sort of external gain or loss that motivates you. — location: [349]() ^ref-36753

Women tend to outperform men by 2% accuracy  in reading emotions Howevser this is only becuasw  women tend to be more interested or curious. The key is motivation.

We can’t help it. And that cover is usually someone’s face. We make our minds up about someone’s assertiveness, beauty, competence, likability, and trustworthiness in less than a second. And, like mind reading, more time doesn’t noticeably change our opinions, it just increases our confidence. — location: [442]() ^ref-62137

---
And, unsurprisingly, a fair amount of this inaccuracy is due to your biased brain. We’re not talking about race or gender biases necessarily, but fundamental cognitive biases wired into our gray matter. Often these are shortcuts. Evolution has optimized our brains for speed or fuel efficiency over accuracy. — location: [458]() ^ref-57889

Paul Nurse takes this attitude to the extreme: “If I have an idea and have observations to support it, rather than get that out there, I go around and look at it in different ways and try and destroy it. And only if it survives do I begin to talk about it.” And maybe that’s why he won the Nobel Prize in medicine. — location: [507]() ^ref-54491

First, listen to that advice you’ve received so many times: make a good first impression. You now know just how important it really is. Make sure you show them the side of your personality that you want them to lock onto—because they will. — location: [512]() ^ref-9633

The other thing to remember: give people a second chance. Without the above strategies, you’re right only 70 percent of the time, max. You’re going to be wrong with at least three out of every ten people you meet. — location: [515]() ^ref-51041

---
This gives you a chance to further evaluate them either way. The result is that your negative judgments about people will be less reliable than your positive judgments. And research also shows we have a higher bar for rating someone positively than negatively, and our positive impressions are more easily reversed than our negative ones. — location: [519]() ^ref-54616

Don’t accuse, be curious. — location: [622]() ^ref-36793

---
Herein lies the problem in dealing with slippery people: they get good feedback, you don’t. If I lie and don’t get caught, I see what works. If I lie and get caught, I see what doesn’t work. On the other hand, the vast majority of the time you don’t get feedback on whether someone was honest with you. So liars are always improving. — location: [629]() ^ref-13352

A study by Simpson, Ickes, and Ortina found that empathic accuracy is a positive if it doesn’t uncover information threatening to the relationship. But if it does, it’s a negative. In fact, if there’s negative information to be gleaned, avoiding accuracy improved relationship stability. — location: [760]() ^ref-51719

Work by Gallup found that 70 percent of marital satisfaction is due to the couple’s friendship. Tom Rath says it’s five times as critical to a good marriage as physical intimacy. — location: [866]() ^ref-14728

Amigo impact in the office is no less significant. Less than 20 percent of people see their manager as a “close friend”—but those who do are 2.5 times more likely to enjoy their job.

Why do true friendships make us happier than spouses or children? Because they’re always a deliberate choice, never an obligation. — location: [906]() ^ref-45811

He was a big, big fan of close friends though. And he even had a heartwarming definition of what one was. To Aristotle, friends “are disposed toward each other as they are disposed to themselves: a friend is another self.” — location: [993]() ^ref-10839

---
We actually confuse elements of who they are with who we are. When you’re tight with a friend, your brain actually has to work harder to distinguish the two of you. — location: [1013]() ^ref-18886

---
In 1980, Harvard professor Daniel Wegner said that empathy might “stem in part from a basic confusion between ourselves and others.” And with that, it seems like we finally have the definitions we’ve been seeking. What is empathy? Empathy is when the line between you and another blurs, when you become confused where you end and another person begins. What is closeness? Closeness is when your vision of your “self” scooches over and makes room for someone else to be in there too. What is a friend? A friend is another self. A part of you. — location: [1022]() ^ref-28134

“I was fascinated on how a genetic defect, a tiny deletion in one of our chromosomes, could make us friendlier, more empathetic and more able to embrace our differences.” It’s not much of a stretch at all to say that people with WS possess the qualities most religions urge us to aspire to: a generous, selfless love for all. Latson writes, “People with Williams don’t have to learn the Golden Rule; they don’t have to be taught about equality or inclusion. They’re born practicing these principles.” — location: [1072]() ^ref-42326

---
Think about the traits we’re discussing: always happy to see others, eager to please, infinitely forgiving, and radiating a deep love for others that’s unquestionably sincere. Those are all the qualities that make us cherish, well . . . puppies. — location: [1066]() ^ref-18591

---
The result? They don’t show any. Zero, zip, zilch, nada. And this is even more surprising because nearly all children by age three show a preference for their own race. Kids with WS are, in fact, the only children ever found to show zero racial bias. — location: [1076]() ^ref-46207

---
So which costly signals do we want to display (and look for) when it comes to true friends? The experts firmly agree on two, the first one being time. Why is time so powerful? Because it’s scarce, and scarce = costly. Want to make someone feel special? Do something for them you simply cannot do for others. If I give you an hour of my time every day, I cannot do that for more than twenty-four people. — location: [1143]() ^ref-49289

---
So what does produce deep, “another self” friendships? This leads us to an area of academic study called “signaling theory.” — location: [1136]() ^ref-50711

---
But making new friends can require even more time. That process can be slower than inflight internet, which is one reason we’re so bad at it as we age. How much time? Are you sitting down? Jeff Hall’s research found that it took as many as sixty hours to develop a light friendship, sometimes one hundred hours to get to full-fledged “friend” status, and two hundred or more hours to unlock the vaunted “best friend” achievement. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but either way—yowzers, that’s a lot of time. — location: [1154]() ^ref-40079

---
So how do we make more time for friends as an adult? The key comes down to rituals. Think about the people you do keep up with, and you’ll probably find a ritual, conscious or not, underneath it. “We talk every Sunday,” or “we exercise together.” Replicate that. It works. Find something to do together consistently. Research from Notre Dame that analyzed over eight million phone calls showed touching base in some form every two weeks is a good target to shoot for. Hit that minimum frequency, and friendships are more likely to persist. — location: [1150]() ^ref-6306

The Scary Rule™: If it scares you, say it. You don’t need to go full bore just yet. Don’t confess to any murders at Christmas dinner. Start slow and build. Stretch the bounds of the sensitive things you’re willing to admit about yourself, and, by the same token, ask more sensitive questions than you’re normally comfortable asking. And when your friend admits vulnerable things, do not recoil and scream, “YOU DID WHAT?!?!” Accept them. Then, Daniel Hruschka says, “raise the stakes.” As long as you feel emotionally safe and you’re getting a positive reception, share more. That’s how you build “another self.” — location: [1185]() ^ref-28300

---
Oh, and not being open and vulnerable doesn’t just kill friendships: it can also kill you. University of Pennsylvania professor Robert Garfield notes that not opening up prolongs minor illnesses, increases the likelihood of a first heart attack, and doubles the chance it will be lethal. — location: [1191]() ^ref-54538

You don’t worry about how big the favor is or what they’ve done for you lately—you’re past that. Now you only have to ask one question: “Are they a friend?” And if they are, you help. — location: [1196]() ^ref-26384

For one thing, it didn’t originate with courtly love in the Middle Ages. Romantic love has been around forever. The earliest love poetry dates back over 3,500 years in Egypt. And love is universal. Of 168 cultures studied by anthropologists, 90 percent recognize it, and in the other 10 percent there weren’t enough data to confirm it. — location: [1502]() ^ref-39084

So marriage is no guarantee of health or happiness; it’s more like gambling: big wins or big losses. And, extending the gambling analogy, the odds are not fifty-fifty. As New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote, “In the United States, nearly 40 percent of marriages end in divorce. Another 10 or 15 percent of couples separate and do not divorce, and another 7 percent or so stay together but are chronically unhappy.” No matter how you slice it, this is no guarantee. It’s a minority of people who are happily married and stay that way. — location: [1535]() ^ref-9746

By the 1970s that “traditional” marriage was already coming apart. States passed no-fault divorce. For the first time, just being unhappy was a legally acceptable reason to end your marriage. By 1980 the US divorce rate hit 50 percent. The centuries-long shift was nearly complete. The unmarried were no longer seen as broken or immoral.

If we get really scientific, which mental disorder does love best resemble? OCD, actually. You’re obsessed. You can’t control your attention and turn it toward your responsibilities. Anthropologist Helen Fisher reports people newly in love spend up to 85 percent of their waking hours thinking about that special someone. Not only does love meet the criteria for OCD, but the neuroscience data match. Look at a brain in love or an OCD brain in an MRI, and it’s hard to tell the difference. The anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, and insula are all working overtime. Psychiatrist Donatella Marazziti took blood from people in love and people with OCD and found both had serotonin levels 40 percent lower than controls. What happens when you test the love group again, months later when the craziness of romance has died down? Serotonin levels are normal again. (Scientist drops mic.) — location: [1713]() ^ref-4332

---
But why would evolution want to give us OCD over someone? What’s the single best framing for the symptoms and behavior of love? Obsession is close, but looking at all the data, the best metaphor is addiction. We’re not washing our hands until they bleed as a semi-arbitrary ritual; we’re in pursuit of something we crave. Ever said, “I can’t get enough of you”? Exactly. High highs and very low lows. Get your fix from a text and you’re good for a while, but soon your junkie soul will need more texts with even more emojis. — location: [1719]() ^ref-65100

1999 study showed that people in happy relationships spend five times as long talking about their sweetheart’s good qualities as bad. As Robert Seidenberg said, “Love is a human religion in which another person is believed in.” — location: [1772]() ^ref-35647

---
Remember the people with HSAM, the ones who had a perfect memory for personal events? And how it screwed up their romantic relationships? Well, a study validated this. Lovers who misremembered their histories in a positive way were less likely to split up than people with more accurate recollections. The facts don’t matter as much as the story we tell ourselves when it comes to happiness. We need the crazy. Love is blind—and should be. — location: [1788]() ^ref-49213

The validity of love might as well depend on our faulty facilities

idealization seems to be the “magic” that’s central to sustaining love. A 2010 study found that “positive illusion” was the single best predictor of holding on to those butterflies in our stomach about someone. But can it “conquer all”? Can it last? Yes. And I don’t mean people just respond to surveys saying, “Oh yeah, we love each other a whole bunch.” You’d expect people to say that, knee-jerk style. But in 2012 social neuroscientist Bianca Acevedo did fMRI brain scans on couples who were married an average of over twenty years. When she showed them pictures of their spouse, some of them did show the same neural responses you see in people who were newly in love. And get this: not only can it last, it can get even better. Not only did these couples show the neural signature associated with having the hots for each other, it actually lacked the anxiety we find in new love. All the good crazy without the bad crazy. Yes, it can last . . . But it usually doesn’t. Those couples are the exception. Most of the time romantic love drops off after a year to a year and a half. You see this in the fMRI studies, the serotonin blood tests, and survey data. The addicts become habituated to the drug, and the high wears off. Logically, it’s understandable. Everyone can’t run around like lovestruck maniacs forever. Your head would explode, and the world would burn down. — location: [1794]() ^ref-36867

After the first four years of marriage, satisfaction drops an average of 15–20 percent. — location: [1810]() ^ref-29167

---
This decline doesn’t necessarily spell utter doom. Most couples shift from the crazy of romantic passion to what is known as “companionate love”—a more relaxed, durable feeling of comfort without the fireworks. But idealization fades. A 2001 study found that “idealistic distortion” was cut in half as couples transitioned from engagement to marriage. It’s the rise of love’s mortal enemy: reality. — location: [1815]() ^ref-11708

How do we fight the entropy and sustain the idealization? — location: [1846]() ^ref-18509

“The support for our basic prediction is consistent with the notion that, in a close relationship, other is ‘included in the self’ in the sense that cognitive representations of self and close others overlap.” — location: [1009]() ^ref-44888
