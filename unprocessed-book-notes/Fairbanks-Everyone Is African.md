Lewontin examined data from seventeen different genes in people classified into seven groups by geographic origin, as named in his article: Amerinds, Australian Aborigines, Black Africans, Caucasians, Mongoloids, Oceanians, and South Asian Aborigines. He found that the degree of genetic variation within each group exceeded that between different groups. In other words, people within a particular racial group varied more among themselves than their overall group varied from other groups. On average, according to his calculation, 85 percent of overall genetic diversity fell within groups, whereas only 15 percent could be attributed to between-group differences. — location: [288]() ^ref-55200

According to their estimates, people worldwide differ on average by about 0.1 percent, evidence that all humans are genetically quite similar to one another. — location: [326]() ^ref-41404

But the individuals used in these analyses originated in three geographically discontinuous regions: Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and east Asia. When a sample of South Indians, who occupy an intermediate geographic position, is added to the analysis, considerable overlap is seen among these individuals and both the east Asian and European samples, probably as a result of numerous migrations from various parts of Eurasia into India during the past 10,000 years. Thus the South Indian individuals do not fall neatly into one of the categories usually conceived as a “race.”…Ancestry, then, is a more subtle and complex description of an individual's genetic makeup than is — location: [339]() ^ref-58886
